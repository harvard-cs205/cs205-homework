Count to Ten:

These results are random. If we program this in parallel, it will take much more time to run this program if the task is relatively small, since opening a processor costs much more time. But if the task is relatively large, using multiprocessor will make the whole process much faster. 

How much faster? 

Under the condition from 10^(-6)â€”>10^(-4), since the task is relatively small, serial version is faster than parallel version. However, under the condition from 10^(-3)->10^(0), the task is relatively large, parallel version will take shorter than serial version.
