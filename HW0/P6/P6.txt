# Qing Zhao's Answer for Problem 6

Section 1: Count to Ten

1) Example Output:

Hi Job 0
Hi Job 1
Hi Job 2
Hi Job 3
Bye Job 0Bye Job 2

Bye Job 3Bye Job 1

Hi Job 4
Hi Job 5
Hi Job 6
Hi Job 7
Bye Job 4
Bye Job 6
Bye Job 7
Bye Job 5
Hi Job 8
Hi Job 9
Bye Job 8
Bye Job 9
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

2) Unexpected Results & explainations:

a. Jobs which starts early may not ends early;
b. Jobs use the same stdout so they may output at the same time
 which makes output messages mixed up.

3) Consequence:

When using multiprocessing module, each process will compete to get
the same kind of resources, e.g. stdin, stdout. So programming in parallel
requires programmers paying attention to the shared resources (e.g. creating
an event monitor).

4) Important scenario:

In some cases when each process is waiting for an event
that only another process in the set can cause, they will be deadlocked.

Section 2: How Much Faster?

1) Trend
a. On the whole, ratio of serial to parallel execution grows with wait time;
b. When waiting time is very short(< 1e-05), retio's trend is comparatively unclear;
c. As wait time grows close to 1s, retio moves toward 4, and tends to be unimproved.

2) As shown in P6.png, when wait time < 3e-05s, most of times retio < 1, which means parallel
program takes longer than itâ€™s serial version. This could be explained by considering system
I/O time, etc.
