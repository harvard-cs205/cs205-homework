A: 
The sequences of the number for each run are different and not in order but 
sometimes we need the sequence to be the same and in order. For example, if we 
would like to print all the student name in alphabetic order then we need the 
output be in order and the same sequence every time of the run.
Here is the example output.
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Hi Job 1
Hi Job 0
Hi Job 2

B: 
The trend I observe is an increasing near-linear curve,where the increase rate
get lower when wait time get larger. And the ratio approaches to 4 when the 
waiting time get larger.
Yes, it is possible that a parallel program could take longer than its serial
version when the wait time is very small because the time saved by 
mulitprocessing would be consumed by the mapping time.
