P6A:
	The output of print Jobs has different order each time the script run.
	After several times of running, I found the order of each sentence appearing is random.
	I think the randomness happened because there is only one input flow for the I/O. 
	Since the burnTime function is run on 4 processor simultaneous, the processors turn the data into I/O at the same time.
	Then the I/O randomly pick one statement to print out.
	We need to make sure that in parallel programming, given specific instructions to handle the situations that severals happened at same time.
	This would be important if we want to print out result of calculation which are solved parallelly and finish at same time.
	In this situation, we may want the result to be printed at a specific order instead of random order.

P6B:
