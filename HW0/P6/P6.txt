1.The Count to Ten
example of the result:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Hi Job 2
Hi Job 1
Hi Job 0
Hi Job 3
Bye Job 2Bye Job 1Bye Job 0Bye Job 3



Hi Job 5
Hi Job 4
Hi Job 6
Hi Job 7
Bye Job 5Bye Job 4Bye Job 6Bye Job 7



Hi Job 9
Hi Job 8
Bye Job 9Bye Job 8



For job 0,1,2,3, 4 processes are ramdomly distributed during each run, i.e we cannot guarantee output order with "map". Thus, the result "Hi job num" will also be randomly posted for these 4 jobs. The same for job 4,5,6,7. 
Therefore, if we consider a problem concerning output order(for example, print top 50 universities in descending order), the randomness of the processes will affect the reslut. 

2. How much faster

The ratio of serial to parallel execution time against sleep time becomes bigger and bigger. If we consider a small sleep time, like 1e-6 or 1e-5, we find the ratio is smaller than 1, which means a parallel program could take longer than its serial version.
