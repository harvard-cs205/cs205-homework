Problem 6
   1. Sometimes, next job is finished before previous job is not done. 
      if the two jobs have sequential dependencies, the result would be wrong.
      So, a next job needs to be wait for a previous jobs which has a sequential      dependency to be done. 
   2. Based on P6B execution, serial execution takes shorter than parallel one
      for small wait times. It seems jobs are not running in parallel when wait
      times are small and overheads of parallelism (scheduling on multiple cores
      , communication, etc.) make jobs run longer. But, when wait times are
      relatively larger, jobs are running in parallel. Since number of processes
      is 4, performance benefits can be achieved about 4x compared to the case
      where jobs are run in serial.
   ==> As mentioned above, parallel execution could take longer than serial
       one as communication between cores, scheduling on multiple cores, and 
       dependencies. These factors could affect the benefit of performance.
