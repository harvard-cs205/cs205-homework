1. Jobs are not opened and closed sequentially, but some jobs are closed before some other jobs were even started.
    This means we cannot just assume that processes that were started earlier have returned. A scenario in which this
    would be important is when the output of a process that has not retrurned yet is needed for the start of the
    execution of a new function.

2. The parallel execution seems to be faster mostly for relatively long wait times.
    Around 10E-5  execution times do not seem to difer much For heigher wait times it is easy for the parallel program
    to split over multiple processes without incurring too much overhead from the splitting. At lower values the wait
    time may actually be shorter that the time involved in starting multiple processes and dividing the work.
