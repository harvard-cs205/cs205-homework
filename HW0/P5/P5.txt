1. The cashier needs to take number of bags - 1 time to count:
   256 - 1 = 255 seconds

2. Now the bookstore can add 16 numbers each time, but the count of next round needs to wait the previous round ended:
   16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 seconds

3. Now each round only needs 1 second to count:
   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = log2(256) = 8 seconds

4. See P5.png. Single cashier takes N - 1 seconds. Infinite cashiers takes ceiling(log2(N)) seconds.
   Plot number of bags from 2 to 1200

5. The communicating time takes effect since the second round count. Each round increases 1 second.
   1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15 seconds
 
6. The cashier who holds all the 256 bags in the beginning distributes the bags to other cashiers. They distribute the bags based on this rule: give the half number of bags in hand to another cashier who has no bags in hand.
   1) Distribute repeatedly till cashiers have only one bag in hand: distributing time costs log2(256) = 8 seconds.
      Communicating the one bag in hand costs 1 second, and then each round costs 2 seconds(communicate and sum up). 8 rounds in total.
      8 + 1 + 8*2 = 25 seconds.
   2) Distribute repeatedly till cashiers have two bags in hand: distributing time costs log2(256/2) = 7 seconds.
      Summing up the two bags in hand costs 1 second, and then each round costs 2 seconds. 7 rounds in total.
      7 + 1 + 7*2 = 22 seconds.
   3) Better strategy:
      Distribute repeatedly till cashiers have four bags in hand: distributing time costs log2(256/4) = 6 seconds.
      Summing up the four bags in hand costs 4 - 1 = 3 seconds, and then each round costs 2 seconds. 6 rounds in total.
      6 + 3 + 6*2 = 21 seconds.
