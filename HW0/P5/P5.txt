Problem 5
   1. 128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 255s
   2. of course it will be faster
      --> 32+4+1 = 37s ==> 6.89x faster
   3. 8s ==> 31.875x faster
   4. P5.py 
   5. need to take one second to move numbers everytime after additions are done
      8 + 7 = 15s
   6. For this case, performance is limited by how many bags can be moved at
      once, memory bandwidth. 
      1) 1 sec to hand a bag from you to a cashier
         1 sec to move the bag from the cashier to a worker
         1 sec to get one more bag to the worker to add them
         1 sec to add the two numbers
