Question 1: 255 seconds
	If one cashier were counting the add the totals of 256 bags it would take 255 seconds because the first count 1+1=2 would count as one secong and every count thereafter would also count as one second 

Question 2: 34 seconds
	Yes, assuming they imidiatelly divide up the work evenly, they can deivide the 256 bags by 8 workers. Each worker than has to count 32 bags which would take 31 seconds to count. Then 4 workers can add up the other bags, taking 1 additional second. Then 2 workers take the sum of 4 people, taking 1 additional second. Finally, the 1 worker adds the final sum of two people, during the last 1 second.

Question 3: 8 seconds
	Assuming there is no communication time between workers, it would take 8 seconds. This starts with having 256 workers and taking each second to add each of the half of the workers namely it takes log2(256)=8.
	
Question 4: log2(N), please find attached P5.png
	It would take infinite number of employees log2(N) seconds to count N bags.

Question 5: 15 seconds
	Every time there is a sum between two numbers there is one additional second, except for the first case. 

Question 6: 
	(each cashier comes and takes 1 bag): 257 seconds 
		It would take 257 secods to count all bags because it would take 256 secods to hand out all of the bags and as your are handing out the bags the employees with the bags can already start counting the bags. The last emplyee to get a bag then has to sum up the last bag with the bag it just received so it would take 1 extra second

	(each cashier comes and takes 2 bags): 130 seconds
		It would take them all getting two bags: 128 seconds
		the last cashier has to take count thier two bags: 1 second
		the last cahsier has to add their count to total count: 1 second
	(Better strategy?): yes, using a recursive relation for dividing up the work
		Better strategy is coded up
