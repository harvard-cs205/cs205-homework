1. It takes 255 seconds.

2. Yes, working together makes the verification faster. 
Each cashier counts the sum of 32 bags using 31 seconds and adding the subtotals up takes 3 seconds, so it takes 34 seconds in total.

3. 2^8 = 256. It takes 8 seconds.

4. See plot.

5. If it takes a second to communicate, then it takes an addtional second to enter the next round of counting. So it takes 8s (counting time) + 7s (communication time)=15s.

6. 1) If each cashier takes 1 bag, the distribution time will be 256s, communication time will be 8s (8 rounds of communication) and counting time 8s (8 rounds). The total is 272s.

2) If each cashier takes 2 bag, the distribution time will be 128s, plus what we calculated in the previous question, the total time will be 128s+15s=143s.
