1. 255 seconds

2. Yes. Splitting the bags evenly among the 8 cashiers, if each sums 32 bags, this will take 31 seconds. Then, 4 cashiers sum their totals with the other 4, in 1 second. 2 cashiers sum theirs with the other 2 remaining in 1 second. And the remaining 2 sum theirs in 1 second. In total, this takes 34 seconds.

3. If 128 employees sum 2 bags, and then 64 employees sum their total with another cashier's total, etc.,  it will take log_{2}{256} = 8

4. It will take an infinite number of employees log_2{N} seconds.

5. The first step still takes 1 second, but all subsequent steps take 2 seconds. In the first step, 128 employees sum 2 bags in 1 second. In the seconds step, each cashier tells their sum to the cashier next to them in 1 second, and one of them sums the 2 numbers in 1 second, and so on. This takes 1 + 2(log_{2}{256} - 1) = 15 seconds

6. Assuming that cashiers cannot communicate their sum and hand their bag at the same time:

In the case that we hand out one bag to each cashier, this will take 256 seconds to hand out the bags to 256 cashiers, plus 1 second for half of them to hand their bags to another cashier, plus 2log_{2}{256} to complete the summing. Thus, this will take 256 + 1 + 2 * 8 = 273 seconds.

In the case that we hand out two bags to each cashier, this will take 128 seconds to hand out 2 bags to 128 cashiers, and then 2log_{2}{256} to complete the summing. Thus, this will take 128 + 2 * 8 = 144 seconds.

Yes, we can do better than this. If x is the number of bags we hand out to 256/x cashiers, it takes 256/x seconds to hand out the bags, x - 1 seconds for each of the cashiers to add the bags they were given, and 2*log_{2}{256/x} to complete the summing. So, we want to minimize: 256/x + (x - 1) + 2*log_{2}{256/x}. Since the number of steps in the combining phase is actually ceil(log_{2}{256/x}) (e.g., if we used 13 cashiers, handing out 20 bags to 12 of them and 16 bags to 1 of them, it would still take 4 rounds, not 3.68, to combine), we only get savings if x is a power of 2. By inspection, one can see that this minimum occurs where x = 16. That is, we hand out 16 bags to 16 cashiers. The total summation takes 39 seconds.
