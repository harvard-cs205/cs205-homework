1, 255 seconds
2, 34 seconds. 8 people and each people takes 32 bags. It takes 31 seconds to finish the counting at the first stage. Furthremore, it takes log2(8) = 3 seconds to finish. So in total it is 31+3 = 34 seconds.
3, 8 seconds
4, done. Its log2(N)(round up to the nearest integer) seconds
5, computing time = 8 seconds. However the communication time is 7 seconds, because at the first stage, the cashier would not need to communicate with himself. so in total it is 15 seconds.
6, If each cashier comes and takes 1 bag. It takes 256 + 8 + 8 = 272 seconds.
if each cashier comes and takes 2 bags. It takes 128 + 8 +7 to finish
and yes, there is better strategies to shorten the time.

For me the best way to is pick 23 to the first guy, and 22 to the second guy, etc.. 
so we need 23 seconds to sum the numbers up, and its also the time required to finish the pick up precedures. And it needs 2*int(log2(23)) = 5*2 to calculate and communicate. So in total is 32 seconds.
