1, 255 seconds
2, 128 seconds. Two people takes 127 seconds to add 128 elements, and take another 1 second to add the total number.
3, 8 seconds
4, done
5, computing time = 8 seconds. However the communication time is 64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 127s,
so the total time is 135s
6, If each cashier comes and takes 1 bag. It takes 256 + 8 + 8 = 272 seconds.
if each cashier comes and takes 2 bags. It takes 128 + 8 +7 to finish
and yes, there is better strategies to shorten the time.

For me the best way to is pick 23 to the first guy, and 22 to the second guy, etc.. 
so we need 23 seconds to sum the numbers up, and its also the time required to finish the pick up precedures. And it needs 2*int(log2(23)) = 5*2 to calculate and communicate. So in total is 32 seconds.
