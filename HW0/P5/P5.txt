1. one cashier has too add 256 numbers, which means 255 additions.
Therefore, 255 seconds.

Answer : 255 sec


2. total 8 coworkers will work together. So each person will have 256/8 = 32 bags.
So adding up 32 bags will take 31 seconds.
After that, each person has to add up what they've got with the coworker to get the total sum.
If we think about tree structure, the height of the tree will be 3.
Summing up each level will take 1 seconds,
thereby resulting total time to be 31+3 = 34 seconds.

Answer : 34 sec


3. If there are infinite number of employees,
then we could think of a tree that has 256 leaf nodes at the bottom.
Since the height of the tree is log2(256) = 8,
it will take 8 seconds.

Answer : 8 sec


4. in P5.png
alone : N-1 sec
infinite : log2(N) sec


5. Again, when we draw a tree, the height would be 8 in total.
So between each steps, communication has to be made.
Therefore, 8-1 = 7 seconds will take additionally because of communication in total.
So 8 sec (for calculation) + 7 sec (for communication) = 15 sec.

Answer : 15 sec


6. 1 bag at a time : In addition to the time we got from problem #5, which is 15 sec,
 256 seconds will take to hand in 256 bags one by one.
 Answer : 256 + 15 = 271 sec

 2 bags at a time : bags should be handed in 128 times (thus total 256 bags),
 128 sec will take additionally.
 Answer : 128 + 15 = 143 sec

 Better strategy : giving 16 bags to each person is better way to reduce the time.
 Then each person will take 15 seconds to sum up 16 given bags,
 and 256/16 = 16 seconds will take to hand in bags,
 and 3 seconds to communicate with each other,
 and 4 seconds to sum up through the level in each tree structure.
 Therefore, total 38 seconds.
