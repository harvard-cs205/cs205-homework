1) It would take 255 seconds to one cashier to add the totals of 256 bags.
   To calculate this we decompose the operation in the successive number of sums that must be done:
   total_time = 128/1 + 64/1 + 32/1 + 16/1 + 8/1 + 4/1 + 2/1 + 1/1

2) Yes, they can verify the total sum faster than the original cashier by herself. 
   It would take them 34 seconds:
   total_time = 128/8 + 64/8 + 32/8 + 16/8 + 8/8 + maximum(4/8,1) + maximum(2/8,1) + maximum(1/8,1)

3) If there are infinite employees then the result corresponds to the binary logarithm of N (where N=number of bags).
   total_time = log(N)/log(2)
   In this case N = 256, so total_time = 8 seconds.

4) See P5.png

5) If it takes one second to communicate a number between two employees, then we need to add one second to each batch of sums and remove one for the last one since no communication happens at that stage.
   total_time = 8*2 -1 = 15 seconds
