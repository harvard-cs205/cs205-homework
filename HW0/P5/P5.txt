1. It would take 255 seconds.

2. Yes. There are a total of 8 people counting, so each person takes on 256 / 8 = 32 bags.
   It takes each person 31 seconds to verify his/her bags. Then they are left with 8 numbers to add.
   Now, they can have 4 people each adding 2 numbers, this takes 1 more second. After which there 
   are 4 numbers left. Again they will have 2 people each counting 2 numbers which takes another second.
   Finally, there are only 2 numbers left and the cashier can verify this, which takes 1 last second. 
   Thus in total they can do this in: 31 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 seconds.
   
3. Even if there are infinite number of employees, only 128 of them can actually do any work since
   there are only 128 pairs of numbers to add initially. This first step takes 1 second. In the next
   step, there is half the number of pairs left (or 64), so following this recursion, it would take a total of
   log(256) * 1 = 8 seconds to verify the sum.
   
4. Let k be such that 2^k >= N >= 2^(k-1). Then with similar reasoning to part (3), it will take 
   the store k seconds to verify the sum. If N is not a power of 2, we can make the process exactly the same as
   in part (3) by adding "virtual" bags with zero counts so that the total number of bags is 2^k. Then the same 
   counting procedure follows.
   
5. In this case, they can start off with 256 people each having a bag (assuming infinite number of employees). 
   Then in the first round, half of them need to communicate the bag numbers with the other half so the latter 
   each has 2 numbers to add. This round takes 2 seconds to complete. Similarly for every consequent round. 
   Since there are 8 rounds in total (in round 8, 2 people each has 1 bag, so one needs to communicate to the 
   other, and the other can add the final two numbers), it will take 2 * 8 = 16 seconds. 
   
6. The following strategy assumes that I (as the adversarial customer) does not want to communicate the bag size 
   to the cashiers, but instead prefers to hand the bags over to them in order to prolong the time. 

   If each cashier takes 1 bag then the total time to hand all 256 bags to the 256 cashiers would be 256 seconds.
   Once they each has a bag, half of the employees can either hand the other half a bag or simply communicate the 
   bag number. In other words, they can follow the strategy in part (5). Thus the total time it will
   take is 256 + 16 = 272 seconds. 
   
   On the other hand, if each cashier takes 2 bags, the bag-exchange time would reduce to 128 seconds. Thus the total
   time would be 128 + 16 = 144 seconds.
   
   However, if one cashier can communicate multiple numbers to multiple cashiers, then it might be best to dedicate 
   one cashier to take all bags from me which only takes 1 second. Then said cashier can communicate each number to 
   255 other cashiers which again takes only 1 second. Then, they can follow the same strategy as in (5), thus the
   total time is 2 + 16 = 18 seconds.
