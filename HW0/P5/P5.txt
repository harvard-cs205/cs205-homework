1. 255 seconds.

2. Yes. They can verify the total sum in 34 seconds.

3. The infinite number of employees can verify the sum in 8 seconds (log2(256)).

4. It will take them ceil(log2(N)) seconds.

5. With communication overhead (where communication can be done in parallel between independent parties), the best time for 256 bags changes to 15 seconds (log2(256) + log2(128)). We give each cashier 2 bags to begin with, in order to skip the initial layer of communication that would occur if we gave each cashier a single bag.

6. We assume that each cashier can begin their computation when they get their bags. If each cashier takes 1 bag from me, then it will take 256 seconds for all the bags to be distributed, and 4 seconds of computation after distribution to finish (since most of the computation as done during distribution). In total it will take 260 seconds. If each cashier takes 2 bags, then it will take 128 seconds to distribute all the bags, and 5 seconds of computation to finish, for a total of 133 seconds. In general, if each cashier takes M bags each, then the total time will be ceil(256/M)+3+M seconds. The best strategy is when this time is minimized, which occurs at M = 16 bags per cashier. This gives a total compute time of 35 seconds.
