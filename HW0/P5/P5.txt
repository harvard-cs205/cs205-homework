1. 255 seconds
2. Yes, 38 seconds. 31 Seconds per person. Then 7 Seconds to sum the 8 people's totals together.
3. The fastest you could sum the numbers is 30 seconds with 16 people. 
4. It would take 2sqrt(N)-2 Seconds.
5. It would take 42 seconds. 
6. For 1 Bag/second:
Time = 256 + 256/N - 3 + 2N
Optimal Amount of People:12
Time = 299 seconds
For 2 Bag/second:
Time = 171 seconds
The best strategy is to hand out the number of bags that each cashier is expected to count all at once. So in this case, hand 23 bags to 8 people and 24 bags to 3 people then you are only adding 11 seconds of time instead of 256 or 128 seconds.
