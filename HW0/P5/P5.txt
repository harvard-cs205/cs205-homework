Question 1: 255 seconds
	If one cashier were counting the add the totals of 256 bags it would take 255 seconds because the first count 1+1=2 would count as one secong and every count thereafter would also count as one second 

Question 2: 34 seconds
	Yes, assuming they imidiatelly divide up the work evenly, they can deivide the 256 bags by 8 workers. Each worker than has to count 32 bags which would take 31 seconds to count. Then 4 workers can add up the other bags, taking 1 additional second. Then 2 workers take the sum of 4 people, taking 1 additional second. Finally, the 1 worker adds the final sum of two people, during the last 1 second.

Question 3: 8 seconds
	Assuming there is no communication time between workers, it would take 8 seconds. This starts with having 256 workers and taking each second to add each of the half of the workers namely it takes log2(256)=8.
	
Question 4: log2(N), please find attached P5.png
	It would take infinite number of employees log2(N) seconds to count N bags.

Question 5: 15 seconds
	Every time there is a sum between two numbers there is one additional second, except for the first case. 

Question 6: **this part was done in colaboration with Thibaut Perol**
	(each cashier comes and takes 1 bag): 230 seconds

	(each cashier comes and takes 2 bags): 132 seconds

	(Better strategy?): No, for having a system where we count two bags at one time, we cannot do better than handing each person two bags at a time. If they were able to count more than two bags at a time, then we would be able to change this strategy.
