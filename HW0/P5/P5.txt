1. 255 seconds.
2. Yes. There are 8 people totally. They can distribute 32 bags to one person and each person only count their own bags. 31+3=34 seconds. In this case, they just need 34 seconds to do it.
3. If there are infinite number of people. They can use divide and conquer algorithm. They can use 128 people to sum each 2 bags first. And then sum them two by two at the same time and continue again until we have one sum. This strategy takes log(256)=8 seconds.
4. If we have N bags. The fastest time to count them would be ceil(log(N))
5. 43 seconds.
6. 1 bag: 299 seconds. 2 bags: 171 seconds. The best strategy is to give bags to each person once and give them all they need at that time.
