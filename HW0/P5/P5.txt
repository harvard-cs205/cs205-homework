1.
It would take (n-1) seconds to sum up . It would take 255 seconds to add up all the bags.

2.
With 8 cashiers, they can work in parallel and process 256/8 bags in 256/8 - 1  = 31 seconds. Then it would take an additional 3 seconds to add up 8 numbers. Therefore, in total it would take 31+3 = 34 seconds to process 256 bags with 8 cashiers.

3.
With an infinite number of cashiers, we will be limited by the number of bags. 256 cashiers can count 1 bag each so the total time is for the 256 cashiers to add up all the bags. Therefore, total time = log2(256) = 8 seconds.

4.
Lone cashier function: N - 1. Infinite cashier function ceil(log2(N)). Plot is shown in P5.png.

5.
Assuming that we have infinite cashiers and that communications between the cashiers take 1 second. We can see that when we have 4 sums/bags left, having 1 cashier or 2 cashiers to count both take 3 seconds. Therefore, the last 4 sums take 3 seconds instead of 4 seconds. So it is easy to see that since communications double for every stage of log2 except for the very last stage where it takes -1 seconds. We can see that the total time to count 256 bags would be 8*2 - 1 = 15 seconds.

If we assume that I as the bag owner can distribute N bags to cashiers to help me distribute the bags.
The entire process will take 2 steps:
1) Distribution of bags will take ceil(log2(N + 1)) where each cashier will give N/2 bags to another new cashier until each cashier ends up with the required amount of bags (1, 2, or optimal).
2) Summing up of the bags with communication and adding costs much like q5

a) 1 bag: This means 256 cashiers will need to be holding 1 bag before they start summing everything up which will take ceil(log2(256 + 1)) = 9 seconds. You will give 128 bags to cashier A and B and in turn, each of them will distribute half of what they have, 64, to another cashier. To sum everything up will take log2(256)*2 for communicating and adding. Total = 9 + 16 = 25 seconds.

If on the other hand, all 256 cashiers have to come to me to get the bags, then it will take N + 1 seconds to add up all the bags. This is because while I am handing out the bags, 2 cashiers  will take 2 seconds to communicate and add up the bags. Total time = 256+2 = 258 seconds.

b) 2 bags: This means 128 cashiers will need to be holding 2 bags before they start summing everything up which will take ceil(log2(128 + 1)) = 8 seconds. To sum everything up will take 1 + log2(128)*2 for communicating and adding (+1 at the start to sum up the 2 bags so we will have 128 numbers). Total = 8 + 15 = 23 seconds.

c) Better way: A better way would be to take advantage of the fact of what we found in part 5 where it takes the same time for 1 cashier to sum up 4 bags as 2 cashiers to sum up 4 bags.
This means 64 cashiers will hold 4 bags before they start summing up ceil(log2(64 + 1)) = 7 seconds. To sum up everyything wiwll take 3 + log2(64)*2 = 15 seconds (+3 at the start to sum up 4 bags so we have 64 numbers). Total = 7 + 15 = 22 seconds.
