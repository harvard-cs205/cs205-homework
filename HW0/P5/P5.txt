Problem 5

1.) 255 seconds
2.) 
      - Each of the eight cashiers adds up 32 bags. It takes a total of 31 seconds.
      - There are now 8 bags. Four cashiers add up 2 bags each. I takes another 1 second.
      - There are no 4 bags. Two cashiers add up 2 bags each. I takes  another 1 second.
      - There are now 2 bags. One cashier adds up the 2 bags. It takes another 1 second.
      - Task is completed in 34 seconds.
3.) 
      - Each of 128 cashiers gets 2 bags and adds them up. It takes 1 second.
      - There are now 64 bags. 31 cashiers add 2 bags each. It takes another 1 second.
                                       .
                                       .
                                       .
                                2^x = 256 
                                    x = 8
                          It takes 8 seconds.

4.) I takes logN seconds for >= N/2 cashiers to add up N bags. It takes N - 1 seconds for one cashier to add up N bags. See plot. 

5.) Each step when two cashiers add up their bags takes 2 seconds instead of 1 second. For 256 it takes 2*8 = 15 seconds (for >= N/2 cashiers).

6.) First 256 bags are handled over to 256 cashiers. This takes 256 seconds. The next 8 consecutive steps require 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 additional seconds for handing over the bags. This adds up to 511 additional seconds (+ 16 seconds for counting and communication).

If 2 bags are handled to each cashier at the beginning the handling takes 510 seconds (+ 15 seconds for counting and communication), since the first step (128 cashiers give one bag each to 128 other cashiers = 1 second) no longer happens.

If handing bags from person to person takes so much time it is best to move the bags to one cashier and let him count all of them. This takes only a total of 511 seconds (255 seconds for counting and 256 seconds for bag handling) and saves resources (cashiers).
