1. The cashier should divide the bags into pairs and sum each pair: 256 bags / 2 = 128 pairs = 128 sums = 128 seconds.  Then divide those 128 sums into pairs and sum each pair: 64 seconds.  This pattern continues until we have the total.

# of Seconds = 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255 seconds

2. Yes, they can sum to the total faster.  There are now 8 cashiers.  By dividing the bags into pairs in the same way, 8 sums can be calculated per second.  Thus the first round only takes 128/8 = 16 seconds.  Using the same logic on subsequent rounds:

# of seconds = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 seconds

3.  We still have log-base-2(256) = 8 rounds of summing.  That means the best we can do is 8 seconds (we will always have a worker to do any available sum).

5.  Now, each communicated sum after the first round takes 1 additional second.  
Since there are still 8 rounds,
# of seconds = time calculating + time communicating = 8 + 7 = 15 seconds.

6. Now it also takes 1 second to hand a bag to another.

If each cashier takes 1 bag from you:
# of seconds = time to hand out bags to cashiers + time to communicate first number (before any calculations) + 8 seconds of calculating + 7 seconds communicating sums = 256 + 1 + 8 + 7 = 272 seconds

Note: my answer above assumes that no bags need to be passed after one cashier reads the number on the bag.

If each cashier takes 2 bags from you, only 128 cashiers need to collect bags and no communication occurs before the first calculation.
Note: this answer assumes that a cashier with 2 bags can instantly read the number from both bags.
# of seconds = distribution time + calculation time + communication time = 128 + 8 + 7 = 143 seconds

The better strategy though would be for you to hand each cashier that approaches you half of the bags in your possession, while you have more that 2 bags.  When you have 2 bags, give both to the next cashier.  Each cashier with more than 2 bags, should also give half their bags to a bag-less cashier.  
Here, you would give 128 bags to the first cashier ==> 1 second
Then you would each give 64 bags to 2 other cashiers ==> 1 second
Note that there are only 7 rounds of bag distribution since each cashier would keep 2 bags.  Thus, distributing bags would take 7 seconds.
# of seconds = distribution time + calculation time + communication time =7 + 8 + 7 = 22 seconds
