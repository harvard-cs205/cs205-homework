1. It will take 255 seconds.
2. Yes, they can do it faster and a sample strategy can be the following. Let each of 8 cashiers take 256 / 8 = 32 bags, and add them up by themselves. Then they can add up all 8 sums into the final result by pairing up. The entire process may take no longer than 31 + 3 = 34 seconds.
3. They can verify the sum in 8 seconds. The number of bags/numbers can at most reduced to its half in a single second. Therefore the time cannot be less than ceil(log_2(256)) = 8.
4. The plotted function is ceil(log2(N)), and the plot is attached as P5.png.
5. If we take communicating time into account, we may notice that for 4 bags, it takes exactly the same amount of time (3 seconds) for 1 cashier or 2. Therefore we have no need to split a work of less than 4 bags to more than 1 cashier. In the meanwhile, the communication doubles the time we add up between cashiers. Then for 256 bags, we need 8 * 2 - 1 = 15 seconds to verify the sum.
6. If each cashier takes 1 bag, the adding and communicating time would be 17 seconds as calculated above. Additionally, log_2(256) + 1 = 9 seconds will be needed to hand bags to each cashier. Hence the total time would be 26 seconds.
   If each cashier takes 2 bags, the adding and communicating time would be 15 seconds and log_2(256/2) + 1 = 8 seconds will be needed to hand bags. The total time would be 23 seconds.
   As we have analyzed above, 4 bags for each cashier is a better strategy. The toal time would be 15 + 7 = 22 seconds.
