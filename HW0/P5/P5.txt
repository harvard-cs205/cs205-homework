1. 
255 seconds.

2. 
Split the bags evenly among 8 cashiers.
Time needed = 256/8 - 1 = 31 seconds
Split the 8 subtotals evenly between 4 cashiers.
Time needed = 8/4 - 1 = 1 second
Split the 4 subtotals evenly between 2 cashiers.
Time needed = 4/2 - 1 = 1 second
Finally, one cashier can add the 2 subtotals to get the total.
Time needed = 1 second
Total time spent = 31 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 seconds

3.
Split the bags evenly among 128 cashiers and generate 128 subtotals.
Time needed = 1 second.
Split the subtotals evenly among 64 cashiers and generate 64 subtotals.
Time needed = 1 second.
And recurse until we have 2 subtotals left.
Total time needed = log2(256) = 8 seconds

4.
If we keep splitting the bags so that each cashier only needs to add 2 numbers during each iteration, total time needed = log2(N).

5.
Considering overhead associated with people communicating, 
each split and count would need 1 second of adding and 1 second of communication overhead except for the initial count and the final count.
So total time needed = log2(256)*2-2 = 14

[TO DO]
If each cashier comes to me and takes 1 bag, then it will take 256 seconds to distribute the bags.
Then, it takes 2 seconds to halve the number of bags.
So total time needed = 256 + log2(256)*2 = 272

Now, if each cashier comes and takes 2 bags, then it will take 128 seconds to distribute the bags and 1 second for each cashier to count the 2 bags.
Then, it takes 2 seconds to halve the number of bags.
So total time needed = 128 + 1 + log2(128)*2 = 143

Finally, the optimal strategy is to distribute the bags to 2 cashiers at first and then recursively split evenly by 2. Each split requires 2 seconds of counting and communicating.
Similar to Q5, total time needed for computation = 14
Time needed to distribute the bags = 2
Total time needed = 14+2 = 16
