a) It takes an employee 255 seconds to add 256 bags.

b) If each of the 8 employees takes care of 32 bags, they would each be done in:

T_each=31s

If then 4 employees add each a couple of the previous totals, and then 2 and then 1, they would be done in 3s.

So in total: T_tot= 34s.

c) By allocating 128 to sum 2 bags each (1s), and then 64 (1s), etc... until only allocating 2 (1s), we have a total of:

T_tot=8s

d) To evaluate the time needed for N bags, we take into account the fact that we can only sum two numbers at a time. We therefore look at the highest power of 2 in N and set the following rule:
if N=2**p, then T=p seconds
if 2**p<N<2**(p+1) then T=p+1 seconds

We use the following python code to evaluate the time and plot:

def timeneeded(N):
	Nbis=N.astype(int)
	p=Nbis.bit_length()-1
	if Nbis==2**p:
		return p
	else:
		return p+1


N=np.linspace(10,300,29)
Time_para=[timeneeded(i) for i in N]
Time_solo=[(i-1) for i in N]
plt.plot(N,Time_solo,'-b',label='1 employee')
plt.plot(N,Time_para,'-g',label='Infinite employees')
plt.xlabel('Number of bags')
plt.ylabel('Time in seconds')
plt.show()

e) If we account for the 1s lag then they would need 15s to check the amount. We need 1s to go from 256 to 128 amounts, then 2s to go to 64 (1 for communication and 1 for computing), 2s to go to 32 etc until 1 amount: 1+7*2=15 s

f) If only on cashier can collect a bag at a time, the result will depend on what order the cashiers come to get the bag. Let's say each cashier goes twice in row to pick up a bag, let's try to spot a pattern:

1-2    3-4    5-6    7-8  9-10   11-12    13-14   15-16
 3      5      7      8    11      12       15      17       here it only takes 1s as no communication is needed
     7      						Now we need 2 sec as we need communication in between cashiers
          9        
                 11  
                       13
                              15
                                     17
                                             19

So we spot a pattern that would lead to an added 251s for 256 bags for a total of 259 seconds. And this is without adding time for bringing the bags from one cashier to another. If cashiers were allowed to take 2 bag at a time, then we would reduce the time. 

The strategy is to find the right balance between how many bags to take and how many employees to use. We might be able to gain some time by taking fewer employees in order to save the time they have to take to transfer the bags and communicating.
