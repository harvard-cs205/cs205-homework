1) When there is at least 2 bags, each addition of the cashier merges 2 bags in 1 in 1 s. As a result, each second the number of bags to be counted decreases of 1. From 256 bags to 2 bags, we have 255 steps of 1 s.
It would take 255 s.

2) Each of the cashier takes 32 bags and sums them: it takes 31 s. At the end we get 8 numbers, 4 cashiers can sum 2 of this number then 2 for the next step and 1 for the last one. It takes 3s.
The employees can verify the sum in 34s.

3) We have an infinite number of employees. At each step we can divide the number of bags to be counted by 2 (same reasoning that in the last part of the previous question).
It would take 8s for the employee (256 = 2**8).

4) See plot and script

5) Between two steps, the employee need to hear from another the number of its bag. Previously, we had with an infinite number of cashiers 8 steps. This change adds 7s.
The answer increased by 7s, it is now 15s.

6) Except for the preliminary step, where the cashiers get the bags from me, this change adds 1s between each step too.
For the preliminary step, it adds 2 * n_e s with n_e the number of employees used if each employee takes one bag (because they will take after the second one) and n_e s if each one takes two of them.
