1. The cashier needs to take number of bags - 1 time to count:
   256 - 1 = 255 seconds

2. Now the bookstore can add 16 numbers each time, but the count of next round needs to wait the previous round ended:
   16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

3. Now each round only needs 1 second to count:
   1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = log2(256) = 8

4. See P5.png. Single cashier takes N - 1 seconds. Infinite cashiers takes ceiling(log2(N)) seconds.
   Plot number of bags from 2 to 1200

5. The communicating time takes effect since the second round count. Each round increases 1 second.
   1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15

6.
