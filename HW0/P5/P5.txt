1. one cashier has too add 256 numbers, which means 255 additions.
Therefore, 255 seconds.

Answer : 255 sec


2. total 8 coworkers will work together. So each person will have 256/8 = 32 bags.
So adding up 32 bags will take 31 seconds.
After that, each person has to add up what they've got with the coworker to get the total sum.
If we think about tree structure, the height of the tree will be 3.
Summing up each level will take 1 seconds,
thereby resulting total time to be 31+3 = 34 seconds.

Answer : 34 sec


3. If there are infinite number of employees,
then we could think of a tree that has 256 leaf nodes at the bottom.
Since the height of the tree is log2(256) = 8,
it will take 8 seconds.

Answer : 8 sec


4. in P5.png
alone : N-1 sec
infinite : log2(N) sec


5. Again, when we draw a tree, the height would be 8 in total.
So between each steps, communication has to be made.
Therefore, 7 seconds will take additionally because of communication in total.
So 8 sec (for calculation) + 7 sec (for communication) = 15 sec.

Answer : 15 sec


6. 1 bag at a time : In addition to the time to communicate, which is 16 sec,
 256 seconds will take to hand in 256 bags one by one.
 Answer : 256 + 16 = 272 sec

 2 bags at a time : bags should be handed in 128 times (thus total 256 bags),
 128 sec will take additionally.
 Answer : 128 + 15 = 143 sec

 Better strategy : Give N bags to the first cashier, and then N-1 bags to second cashier,
  and N-2 to third cashier and so on. Then at the moment when I give the last one bag to the last cashier,
  the other cashiers would have done their summation.
  To get the N, N + (N-1) + ... + 1 = N(N-1)/2 should be 256.
  Such N is around 23. So until now it takes 23 seconds.
  Then, N people should communicate and sum up.
  Communication will take log2(32) (since 32 is the nearest number of power of 2 to 23) seconds for communication
  and log2(32) seconds for summing up.
  Therefore, 5 + 5 + 23 = 33 seconds in total.
