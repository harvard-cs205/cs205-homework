1. This would take 255 seconds

2. 
16s to get 256 bags -> 128
8s to get 128 bags -> 64
4s to get 128 bags -> 32
2s to get 32 bags -> 16
1s to get 16 bags -> 8
1s to get 8 bags -> 4
1s to get 4 bags -> 2
1s to get 2 bags -> answer

= 34 seconds

3. 2^x = 256,
x = 8 seconds

4. It would take log(n)/log(2) seconds. Same as log_2 (N).
See attached plot

5. It will take 7 extra seconds because in each round we will need
to take an extra second to talk to another person (except the last). So 15 seconds.

6. Once we are able to hand out all the bags to the cashiers, this problem can reduce to 
be the same as problem 5 above. It takes us 256 seconds to hand out every bag to all the cashiers,
and one second to pass bags between workers so that they are able to have two bags to be able to add
together. From there on, we have the same situation as above, and can do 256 + 1 + 15 to get a total of
272 seconds. 
From the second part, when we can hand out 2 bags at a time, we cut the amount of time that we need to hand
out the bags in half and also remove the need to take an additional second to allow cashiers to sum two bags
(since they already have 2 to begin with). So this ends up being (256/2) + 15 = 128 + 15 = 143 seconds.
