1. It will take (N-1) addition operations to sum the totals of N bags.
Each addition operation takes t_add = 1s, so the time required is

t_required = (N-1)t_add = 255 seconds

2. Yes, they definitely can verify the total sum faster. If there are
zeta employees, the minimum time to add the total of N bags is

t_minimum = [(N/zeta - 1) + Log2(zeta)]t_add

The first step corresponds to giving N/zeta bags to each employee and
the employees sum all of the bags given to them. The second step
(the Log2 one) corresponds to employees summing their totals down a
binary tree, i.e. reading the below figure from top to bottom,

x x x x x x x x
 |   |   |   |
 x   x   x   x
   |       |
   x       x
       |
       x

where the number of x's in the first row are the number of employees. I
believe this is the fastest way for them to pool their totals.

The minimum time for this step is, plugging in N=256, zeta=8, is

t=34 seconds

3. The minimum number of bags that employees can initially have and
help add the totals is 1. Therefore, the maximum number of employees
that can meaningfully help out is zeta=N. Plugging in zeta=N into
the equation above gives an intuitive result; in the infinite case,
 employees just have to sum down the tree. Therefore,

 t_infinite = Log2[N]t_add

 Plugging in numbers yields

 t_infinite = 8 seconds

 4. So again, if there are N bags and zeta employees, the general
 formula is given by

 t_minimum = [(N/zeta - 1) + Log2(zeta)]t_add


The two limits we are interested in yield

t_one = (N - 1)t_add
t_infinite = Log2[N]t_add

See P5_part4.py for the python program to produce the plot. See P5.png
for the plot.

5. We are supposed to assume we can still utilize an infinite number of
employees. The fastest way employees can total, even with the
communication barrier, is via summing down the binary tree. Per level
of the tree, it will now take

t_per_level = t_add + t_communicate

Giving us, in the case of an infinite number of employees,

t_infinite = Log2[N](t_add + t_communicate)

Since t_add=t_communicate=1s, t_infinite will be doubled, giving us
(when we plug in numbers)

t_infinite = 16 seconds

6. This last piece is a little more tricky.

a) If it takes 1 second to hand a bag to an employee and we only add one
bag at a time, it does not matter how many employees are working;
there is a huge bottleneck here! The employee will certainly have to wait

t_wait = N*t_hand

before obtaining the total. After receiving the final bag, the employee
will have to add that one. Therefore,

t_one_bag_at_a_time = t_wait + 1 = N t_hand + 1
t_one_bag_at_a_time = 257 seconds

b) If each cashier takes two bags, things will become much better.
In general, if you hand q bags out at a time, then

t_wait = (N t_hand)/q

At the end of t_wait, N/q employees will have summed their bags. They
can then sum down the binary tree to obtain their totals. But,
only N/q employees will have bags at the top of the tree. Therefore,

t_q_bags_at_a_time = t_wait + t_sum_down_tree
t_q_bags_at_a_time = (N t_hand)/q + Log2[N/q](t_add + t_communicate)

Plugging in N=256, q=2, we find

t_total = 142 seconds

c) The most efficient strategy is to distribute bags as fast as
possible. It only takes t_hand to hand *any number of bags* to an employee.
Therefore, we should employee another binary tree method to hand bags
out to employees as fast as possible. Sketching the idea,

      N
    |   |
   N/2 N/2
|    |   |   |
N/4 N/4 N/4 N/4

etc. You start with N bags and hand half to the next employee.
That employee hands half to another employee, and this repeats until
each employee has 1 bag. At this point, employees sum down the binary
tree via communicating with each other. The solution will then scale as
Log2[N] which is quite fast. We thus find

t_minimum = Log2[N] t_hand + Log2[N](t_add + t_communicate)

Simplifying,

t_minimum = Log2[N](t_hand + t_add + t_communicate)

Evidently, the fastest handing strategy results in 3 times the original
infinite solution (without communication lag). Plugging in numbers,
we find

t_minimum = 24 seconds
