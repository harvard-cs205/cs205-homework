1. 255 m
2. Yes.
	8 people in total
	First, each person count 32 cases, take them 31 ms, result in 8 new numbers
	Second, 4 people each sum 2 of the 8 numbers, take them 1 m, result in 4 new numbers
	Thirdly, 2 people each sum 2 of the 4 numbers, take them 1 m, result in 2 new numbers
	Finally, sum the 2 numbers, take them 1m
	In total, they spend 34 ms

	They can count all cases in 34ms.
3.8ms
4.log2(n)
5.8 + 7 = 15
6. if one person take one bag at a time: it tooks 8 + 8 + 256 = 272 ms
   if one person take two bags at a time: 15 + 128 = 143 ms 
   Best strategy:
	Yes, best way can be achieved by reducing time wasted on getting bags
	for example:
		16 people each take 16 bags, take 16 ms
		take 15 ms for each person to count
		take 4 + 4 ms for them to sum up numbers
		in total, it take 16 + 15 + 8 = 39 ms
