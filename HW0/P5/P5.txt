1.  For one cashier, there are a total of 255 additions to do, so it will
    take 255 seconds.

2.  Yes, they will be able to verify the amount faster.
    One of the methodologies the cashiers could adopt is as follows:
        a.  all 8 cashiers start by adding totals concurrently, without
            touching other cashiers' bags
        b.  after Step (a) being repeated for 31 times, there are 8 bags
            left. 4 of the 8 cashiers (randomly selected) then perform
            the addition between 2 bags sequentially, resulting in 4 sums.
        c.  Then 2 of the 8 cashiers perform the similar addition in
            Step (b), resulting in 2 sums.
        d.  The bright and optimistic cashier perform the final addition
            between the two bags.
    This will take 31+1+1+1=34 seconds, instead of 255 seconds, a 7.5x
    improvement.

3.  It will take ceiling(log2(256))=8 seconds.
    The methodology used in (2) and here is based on backward thinking-
    before the final answer comes up, the last step must be 1 addition
    from the remaining 2 sums; the second last step, if fully utilized,
    would be 2 additions from the remaining 4 sums; so for the nth second
    from the end, there are at most 2^n remaining sums to be added.
    In that sense, for 256 (=2^8) bags, we want to start with 128 additions
    (additional cashiers won't help in this case), and then 64, then 32...
    This leads to my calculation of log2(256)=8 steps.

4.  Derived from the logic in (3), at the nth second from the end, there
    can be at most 2^n bags remaining to be added. Hence:
        2^t > N
    t = ceiling(log2(N))
    For a single cashier, N bags take N-1 seconds to count. Please see
    graph attached.

5.  If an overhead of 1s is added, then before each additions when there are
    less sums than cashiers, 1 second will be added to each additions. In the
    case of 256 bags, it will take 8+7=15 seconds.

6.  If each cashier comes to me and takes 1 bag, then it will take 256 seconds
    for me to hand out all the bags, plus 1 second during which half of the
    cashiers hand their bags to other cashiers for the first sum. Then the total
    time will be at most 256+1+15=272 seconds. However, the best time under this
    scenario will be shorter, because cashiers could start summing/passing/telling
    the coins while I am handing coins to new cashiers. It would take at least 258
    seconds, to communicate and sum the last bag.
    If each cashier takes 2 bags, then it will take 128 seconds for me to hand out
    all bags. Similarly, it will take at most 128+15=143 seconds, and at least 131
    seconds.

    There exist better strategies because giving more bags at the same time. For
    example, if I am handing out 16 bags at a time, then it takes me 16 seconds to
    deliver all the bags; then each of the 16cashiers sums and add his/her 16 bags,
    spending 15 seconds; then they start to communicate and sum, which for 16 sums
    takes another 4*2=8 seconds. In this sense, a total of 16+15+8=39 seconds would
    be needed. Of course, this time can still be reduced, because we can start summing
    concurrently while I am still handing out bags.
