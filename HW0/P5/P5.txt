1. 255 seconds.
2. Yes. There are 8 people totally. They can distribute 32 bags to one person and each person only count their own bags. 31+3=34 seconds. In this case, they just need 34 seconds to do it.
3. If there are infinite number of people. They can use divide and conquer algorithm. They can use 128 people to sum each 2 bags first. And then sum them two by two at the same time and continue again until we have one sum. This strategy takes log(256)=8 seconds.
4. If we have N bags. The fastest time to count them would be ceil(log2(N))
5. If it takes 1 second to communicate between two cashier, it takes one more second to sum two number from two cashier. However, not every step takes 1 more second. At the first step of summing two bags, they don't need to communicate. Therefore, it takes log2(256)*2-1=15 seconds.
6.
   1 bag: It takes 1 second to give all bags to one cashier and this cashier takes 8 seconds to distribute 1 bag to everyone. After that, it takes 1 second to comunicate between every two cashier and 1 seconds to sum. And then continue this step until summing up to 1 number. As a result, it takes 1+8+8*2 = 25 seconds.
   2 bags: It is similar to 1 bag but save 1 seconds in distributing bags and 1 seconds to sum up bags from 1 bag in two cashiers. There fore, it takes 25-1-1 = 23 seconds. 
   There is a better strategy. First, I should give all bags to a cashier and this takes 1 second. And then this cashier can give 128 bags to another cashier and this takes another second. Every time the cashier do this, it takes 1 second. Now there is a problem: when to stop giving bags and count bags themselves. The answer is when they have 4 bags, they should count them themselves. If cashier give it to other, it takes 1 second to give it to another cashier, 1 second to sum two bags, 1 second to communicate and 1 second to sum two number, so it would be 4 seconds. However, if cashier counts himself, it just takes 3 seconds. 
To sum up, they should give half of the bags in their hand to another cashier until they have 4 bags in hand and this strategy takes 7+3+6*2=22 seconds.
