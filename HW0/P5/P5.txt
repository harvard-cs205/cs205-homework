1. 255 seconds.

2. Yes. They can verify the total sum in 34 seconds.

3. The infinite number of employees can verify the sum in 8 seconds (log2(256)).

4. It will take them ceil(log2(N)) seconds.

5. With communication overhead (where communication can be done in parallel between independent parties), the time for 256 bags changes to 16 seconds (2*log2(256)). In general, for N bags it will take 2*ceil(log2(N)) seconds.

6. If each cashier takes 1 bag from me, it will take 272 seconds (256 seconds for each cashier to get their bag + 0 seconds for each cashier to sum their bags + 2*log2(256) = 16 seconds for the results to be combined). If each cashier takes 2 bags, it will take 143 seconds (256/2 = 128 seconds for each cashier to get their bags + (256/128)-1 = 1 second for each cashier to sum their bags + 2*log2(128) = 14 seconds for the results to be combined). In general, if each cashier takes M bags each, then the total time will be 256/M + M-1 + 2*ceil(log2(256/M)) seconds. The best strategy is when this time is minimized, which occurs at M = 16 bags per cashier. This gives a total compute time of 39 seconds.
