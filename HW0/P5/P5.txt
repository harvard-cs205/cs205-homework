1. It would take him 256 seconds.

2. They can do it in 1/7th of the original time, plus a little overhead of 6 seconds to add up the different piles of
    pennies.

3. There is one cashier per bag. Therefore it would take 256 plus an overhead of 255 seconds to add up the
    different bags.

4. See png.

5. I already took that into account in my answers above

6. For 1 bag: 256 (hand to cashiers) + 256 / number of cashiers + 255 second communication time
    For 2 bags: ( 128 (hand to cahsiers) + 128 / number of cashiers + 127 seconds communication time ) * 2 since we need
    to count double the amount of bags.

    A better strategy would be to count bags in parallel to the point where the decrease in counting time plus the
    overhead communication costs reach a minimum. Doing a quick calculation minimizing 256/n + (n - 1) brings the optimum
    to 16 cashiers.
