In this problem, since locations close to one another tend to have similar
final iteration counts.Therefore, with the default partitions, some workers
have much high compute loads if they have to be around the high iteration 
region. To optimize, I partitioned the image RDD by a hash function that 
randomly assign to 100 partitions. This way, the total compute is
distributed evenly among the partitions and we're likely to see a histogram
that shows a normal distribution due to the Central Limit Theorem.
