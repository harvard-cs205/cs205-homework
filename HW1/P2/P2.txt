I tried two methods of partitioning using the partitionBy command. One
was before the map of the pixels across the mandelbrot function, and one
was after.  Comparing the histograms, you could see that the work was
more evenly spread across the partitions in the partitionBy occurring
after the .map() statement.  Both were improvements on the default
partitioner though, which was very lopsided as can be seen in the png
file. The partitionBy before map had higher counts at the two extremes,
whereas the partitionBy after map had more of a bell shape to it.  The
latter is preferred as we do not want to much time being spent in one
partition doing high iterations in the mandelbrot function.
