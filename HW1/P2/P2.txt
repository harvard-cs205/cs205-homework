The graph for part a is scaled by 1e7, which is why it
looks relatively clustered.  The graph for part b on the other hand is tightly
clustered around a small range of values just above 200,000. Thus we see that
the solution of a random repartition balances work *extremely* well.  However,
it does require a single full shuffle of all the data.
