Answer: As the information given in the instruction, location close to one another tend to have 
similar final iteration counts. Thus, if we put those local values under the same partition, the iteration counts for that specific partition will tend to have same iteration counts. That's been said, if we shuffle our list, then each parition has different points to calculate, the more efficient the program could be.
