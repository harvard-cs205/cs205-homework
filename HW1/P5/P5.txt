For Kevin to Harvard, I was able to run bfs on my local machine in 2 minutes. But I am only able to run bfs from Harvard to Kevin on AWS.
Using 5 instances, I was able to get the result in around 15 minutes. I don't think my code is parallized enough, there are a few collects
made in each iteration to get the neighbors of currently visiting nodes. 

			---Results---
'Kevin_Bacon' -> 'Six_degrees_of_separation' -> 'Harvard_university'

'Harvard_university' -> 'Tommy_Lee_Jones'->'Gene_Hackman'->'Kevin_Bacon'
