Shortest Paths:

P5_bfs.py is a script to comptute shortest paths between 2 nodes. From Kevin Bacon to Harvard, the shortest
paths have distance 2. While the script prints all paths, only one is required and that is below. The paths
are listed as the page indices so I added a couple of lines in the script to look up the indices for the paths 
below (not shown, I forgot to save the lookup lines). You can see all the paths in the file full_list.txt. 
The shortest paths from Harvard to Kevin have distance 3. 

Kevin To Harvard:
[u'Kevin_Bacon', u'Marisa_Silver', u'Harvard_University']
also represented as [2729536, 3229511, 2152782]

Harvard To Kevin:
[u'Harvard_University', u'Cornell_University', u'Empire_State_Building', u'Kevin_Bacon']
also represented as [2152782, 1185660, 1593422, 2729536]

Connected Components:

I form my nodes using all lines in the page_names file. This results in a lot of nodes with no 
edges as seen below. 

Case 1. Keep all edges (directed edges are treated as undirected) connected components by size:

I find connected components by starting BFS from a random collection of 500 nodes. While some
of these nodes may be in the same connected components, I use the indices of the nodes as the 
stopping criterion. More specifically, for each node, I store the minimum index of any node that 
has visited it. Once all the stored values stop changing, then all the connected components touched
by the 500 nodes have been fully explored. Each connected component is labeled with the same 
minimum index of the node in the connected component that is also in the original set of 500. 
I use this technique to remove explored nodes and keep track of the component sizes.

Number of connected components: 6373
Biggest connected component size: 5709800

Size  Number of Connected Componenets
1   : 5815
2   : 504
3   : 37
4   : 12
5   : 4
6   : 1
5709800: 1

Case 2. Only Keep symmetric edges connected components:

Number of connected components: 19569
Biggest connected component size: 5696043

Size  Number of Connected Componenets
1   : 18566
2   : 891
3   : 72
4   : 24
5   : 6
6   : 5
7   : 1
8   : 1
14  : 1
16  : 1
