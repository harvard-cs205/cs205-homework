Use your code to compute one of the shortest paths from “Kevin Bacon” to “Harvard University”, and the reverse (Harvard to Mr. Bacon). Report these results in your writeup below

The shortest path I found from Kevin to Harvard is as follows:
['Kevin_Bacon', u'College_Bowl’, ‘Harvard_University’]

The shortest path from Harvard_University to Kevin_Bacon was:
['Harvard_University', u'Cornell_University', u'Edmund_Bacon', 'Kevin_Bacon']

I really struggled on this problem as the code that I originally wrote for my BFS was just too computationally heavy, it would take forever to run! I got help from Patrick Kupier and this problem and he showed me a much simpler way to implement the BFS. Instead of having a flag bit for whether or not I’d seen a node (which required me to do many more filter, unions, and subtract by keys) I implemented this simpler method and everything worked fine. After weeks of struggling with this pset, I’m happy to say that it is over!
