A shortest path from Harvard University to Kevin Bacon (2 steps):

Harvard University -> Marisa Silver -> Kevin Bacon

A shortest path from Kevin Bacon to Harvard University (3 steps):

Kevin Bacon -> Jack Lemmon -> Mister Roberts (film) -> Kevin Bacon

# The approach
We adjust the BFS algorithm from P4 to also store the path at each step. At the end, it is simply a matter of
reading the path. Specifically, each element in the RDD is as follows:

( node_index, ( current_dist, adj_list, color, path ) )

where "path" is a Python list with the nodes traversed from source to node_index.

We can use this same algorithm to check for connected components, but we need to convert the Wikipedia graph into
the two graphs per the specification.

However, BFS is quite slow since it takes O(N) iterations in the worse case (completely disconnected graph.)
There are faster algorithms like Hash-to-min which is lg(D) iterations where D is the diameter of the graph, and
union star which is [lg(N)]^2 iterations.

Unfortunately the algorithm was taking a long time and I could not get an answer on AWS in time. However, the
Wikipedia graph was being correctly transformed into the two graphs required so it should be able to find the answer
given enough computing time.

# Environment
Both parts of the problem were done on AWS through the interactive PySpark shell so that errors could be quickly
debugged.

24 partitions were used since 3 xlarge instances were created on AWS, each with 4 virtual cores.

preservePartioning was used when there were operations which did not change the key, but the nature of the
algorithm chosen means there were constantly new elements being added to the RDD through flatMap.

Rather than join the page names and operate on the strings, the initial numbers were used for
fast comparisons in the graph RDD. Only at the end do we look up the corresponding names from the path.
