Harvard University -> Syracuse University -> WFUV -> Kevin Bacon


NOTE: In today’s Wikipedia, both of these paths contain missing links. However, they were both valid paths when the dataset was created. This can be confirmed by searching links-simple-sorted.txt.

One example possible change: on January 22, 2009, near the time the dataset was posted, the wiki page for Syracuse University had a list of New York college radio stations at the bottom, which contained a link to Fordham’s WFUV. Syracuse’s current page does not have this list, and thus has no link to WFUV. Compare
