Note that helper functions are stored in the "network_commands" python module in the directory above this one.
I wanted to place all of my network code in the same place.

###### Shortest path #######

The shortest path between 'Harvard_University' and 'Kevin_Bacon' is of length 3. One example is

[u'Harvard_University', u'Tommy_Lee_Jones', u'JFK_(film)', u'Kevin_Bacon']

There are a ton of choices to use for the path, of course.

For fun, I found the shortest path between 'Bob_Saget' and 'Satan'. There is a
surprisingly short distance of 3 between the two. One such path is

[u'Bob_Saget',
 u'Musical_theatre',
 u'South_Park:_Bigger,_Longer_&_Uncut',
 u'Satan']

which makes intuitive sense to me.

##### Connected Components #####

I have implemented an algorithm that will compute the number of connected components
in O(D) iterations; I don't think it converges in O(log(D)), but maybe I somehow got O(log(D)) unknowingly. The
algorithm works in a couple of steps:

1. Assign each node in the graph a unique integer ID
2. Pass the ID of each parent to their children
3. If the ID passed to the child is smaller than the child's current ID, the child adopts the new ID
4. Goto 2, repeat until the number of unique ID's converges to a constant value.

The maximum amount of time it will take for one node to see the effect of another node is O(D) as the maximum
number of nodes between two nodes is D and information propagates along one node per iteration.

### Undirected Graph ###

In the undirected graph, we assume every connection is symmetric, i.e. if a node points to another, they are connected.
When we run our code, we find the following output:

Beginning of Iteration 1
Before update: 5710993 groups
Beginning of Iteration 2
Before update: 1343504 groups
Beginning of Iteration 3
Before update: 217823 groups

Beginning of Iteration 10
Before update: 1114 groups
Beginning of Iteration 11
Before update: 1113 groups
Finished at end of iteration 11 !
There are  1113  groups in the network.

Our algorithm converges in 11 iterations, implying that the diameter of the graph is D ~ 11. To see the convergence
of our algorithm vs. iteration, see "undirected_graph_components_vs_iteration.png." Our graph ultimately has 1113 groups.

Within this graph, the largest connected component consists of 5709800 individuals. The next largest connected component
only has 5 individuals! So basically, all nodes on wikipedia are connected if connections are symmetric! A histogram of
the number of nodes per connected component can be seen in "undirected_num_nodes_per_component.png."

### Directed Graph ###

The directed graph is slightly more tricky; nodes are only connected if they both point to each other. Now, if a
parent node points to only one child and the child does not point back, the parent node is connected to no other nodes!
We consequently expect the number of connected components in the directed graph to be larger. We also expect that
the diameter of the path D should be larger as nodes will have to take a more convoluted path to communicate with
each other.

There are  77249  groups in the network.

See the plot "directed_graph_components_vs_iteration.png" to see the convergence of my algorithm. Ultimately, we find
77249 connected components.

We also find that the largest group has 1977524 nodes in it. This is a significantly smaller number than the
symmetric case. We also find that smaller groups of connected components occur frequently; a histogram
of the number of nodes per group can be seen in "directed_num_nodes_per_component.png". Overall, this is what we
would expect. The second largest connected component consists of 157 nodes.
