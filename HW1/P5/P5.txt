Did not manage to make my code work on AWS but the code works locally on the Marvel graph and a test graph created in the same way as the Wikipedia graphâ€¦

I added the test graph and the python code used to test it, result are:

([('10', 4)], [('10', (['8', ['4', ['2', ['1', '<-']]]], 4)), ('10', (['8', ['7', ['3', ['1', '<-']]]], 4))])

which means two paths of equal length 4 and their details.
