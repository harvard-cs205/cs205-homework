---------Shortest Path----------------

'Kevin_Bacon'--------->'John_Lithgow'--------->Harvard_University(arrived!)

and

'Harvard_University'--------->'September_16'--------->'Mickey_Rourke'--------->Kevin_Bacon(arrived!)

--------------------------------------


The above path is not unique but it is correct. Since I check 'John_Lithow' was a neighbor of 'Kevin_Bacon' and 'Harvard_University' is a neighbor of 'John_Lithow'. 

'September_16' is a neighbor of 'Harvard_University', 'Mickey_Rourke' is a neighbor of 'September_16', and 'Kevin_Bacon' is a neighbor of 'Mickey_Rourke'.



For connected components:
My script is correctly working on P4's small dataset but not on the large dataset of P5.

My algorithm is:
1, make two different graphes - asymmetric and symmetric
2, bfs on one note, find a cc, then change to another node which is not in that cc
3, count the largest number of a cc, and number of connected components.
