The graph is a list of tuples, each tuple is consisted of a character as key, and the characters that are linked to this character as a list of values. It is of the form:
[(char1, [char2, char3]), (char2, [char1, char3]), â€¦ ]


The number of touched nodes in each of the searches is as below:
"CAPTAIN AMERICA"
1906
4463
38
0


"MISS THING/MARY"
6
0

"ORWELL"
8
0

We assume the diameter of the graph is 10. This implies that the maximum number of steps in which we search is 5. 

If a character does not have a defined distance during the search, this means this character is not touched in this search, and is not in the comic with any one of the characters in the graph.
