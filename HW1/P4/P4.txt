We use adjacent list for the graph representation. In RDD format, it looks like

(node, [adj_1, adj_2, ..., adj_n])

Our result for this question is
CAPTAIN AMERICA 6408
MISS THING/MARY 7
ORWELL 9

The original algorithm only works for a graph with diameter no more than 10. However with a variable keeping track with visited nodes, we do not have such restriction anymore.
The refined algorithm stops when all nodes in a connected component are traversed. And the rest nodes are untouched.
