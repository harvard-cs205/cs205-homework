The graph I use is a table of tuples which have the shape: (key_hero, [list of neighbor heros])
And in the BFS, I extend the nodes to something like: (key_hero, ([list of neighbor heros], distance_to_starting_node) 

For “CAPTAIN AMERICA”, the number of nodes visited is:
Current Level:  0 Newly Visited Nodes:  1906 
Current Level:  1 Newly Visited Nodes:  4463 
Current Level:  2 Newly Visited Nodes:  38 
Total Nodes Touched: 6408

For “MISS THING/MARY”:
Current Level:  0 Newly Visited Nodes:  6 
Current Level:  1 Newly Visited Nodes:  0 
Total Nodes Touched:  7

For "ORWELL”:
Current Level:  0 Newly Visited Nodes:  8 
Current Level:  1 Newly Visited Nodes:  0 
Total Nodes Touched:  9

For the first question, the diameter of the graph actually determines the number of iterations you need to go through. Because it's a BFS, it searches all the nodes in the same level before going to the next level of the graph.
And for the second question, if a character doesn't have a defined distance(or INFINITE distance), then we know it hasn't been touched yet.
