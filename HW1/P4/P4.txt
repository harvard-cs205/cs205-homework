My graph representation was a pair RDD where key is character
and value is characters in the same book.

Number of touched nodes
'CAPTAIN AMERICA':
6403 if all whitespaces in the character name  were stripped (which should be more accurate?)
6408 if whitespaces were not stripped
'MISS THING/MARY': 7
'ORWELL': 9

A defined diameter(n) is the maximum distance we could reach apart from the root node, which means
the search process would stop if it already take n iterations or no new nodes could be touched.

Untouched nodes are the nodes that are not connected to the root node. If we have a defined diameter,
untouched nodes could also be the nodes of which the distance to the root node is larger than the
defined diameter.
