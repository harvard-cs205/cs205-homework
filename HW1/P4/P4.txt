---Graph Representation---
Graph = [(HeroName,[HeroName1,HeroName2]),(),...]
Each hero is a key, and value of that hero is a list with the heros that the key is associated with.(Been in the same comic)

Q1.What does this diameter imply about the maximum number of steps in which your
search must be executed?
A1.Given diameter d, then the maximum number of steps is d. For example, if we had a linear tree of 11 nodes, then the diameter is 10.
Given this info, we could have a for loop and know when to exit the loop.

Q2.What does it mean if a character does not have a defined distance during the
search?
A2.If a node does not have a defined distance, then that node is not associated with our
starting character.
