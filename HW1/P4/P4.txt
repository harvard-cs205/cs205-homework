Number of nodes touched excluding root node
(+1 if counting root node)
Orwell: 8
Miss Thing/Mary: 6
Captain America: 6407

If a character does not have a defined distance during the search means that the character does not share an edge to another character. It is disjoined from the rest of the graph.

A description of your graph representation, and the number of touched nodes in each of the searches above. Also, discuss the two questions above (re. graph diameter, and untouched nodes).

For my graph, I use a RDD to store (character, list of characters sharing an edge []).

Here is the output of characters that appeared with 'ORWELL'
graph.lookup('ORWELL')
