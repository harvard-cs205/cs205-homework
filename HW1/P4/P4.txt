I represent the graph as an adjacency list where the keys are the nodes and 
the values are sets of neighbors of the nodes. When implementing the BFS job,
I keep track of the traversed nodes and the search terminates when the number 
of neighbors yet to be traversed drops to 0.

Below are the number of nodes touched in both the serial implementation and 
parallel implementation of BFS job. The root is not counted.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Nodes touched: 6407

ORWELL
Nodes touched: 8

MISS THING/MARY
Nodes touched: 6

The maximum number of steps is equal to the diameter of the graph as you 
reach nodes you've already traversed beyond the diameter.

If a character does not have a defined distance during the search, this means
that the character is not connected with the root character via other 
characters in associated comics.
