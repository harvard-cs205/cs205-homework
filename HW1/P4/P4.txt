Setting a graph diameter of 10 implies that the graph will only find all nodes 
with distance 10 or less from the source node. 

”CAPTAIN AMERICA” - 6408 nodes 
”MISS THING/MARY” - 7 nodes
”ORWELL” - 9 nodes

When a node does not have a defined distance, that means it was never touched
by the search, i.e. it does not belong to the same connected component, and there
is no connection between that node and the source.
