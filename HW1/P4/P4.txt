What does this diameter imply about the maximum number of steps in which your search must be executed?
If the diameter of the graph is 10, that means that the longest shortest path between any
two nodes in the graph is 10.  Since BFS finds shortest paths between a source node and every other node,
and each iteration i of BFS explores paths of lengths i, this implies that BFS can run for at most 10
iterations in this graph: this makes coding BFS easier, because we don't have to keep track of anything
as a stop condition!

If a character does not have a defined distance in the graph, this means that that character
is unreachable, a.k.a. disconnected from the source character (different connected component).

My graph representation was an adjacency list: an RDD which maps each character name to a list
of characters with whom they have appeared in a comic.

The number of touched nodes in the searches were:

Captain America: 6408
Miss thing/Mary: 7
Orwell: 9
