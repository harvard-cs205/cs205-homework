Graph diameter:
If the diameter of the graph is 10, we should never need to take more than 10 steps outwards from a source node to find all connected components to that source, as the largest distance between any nodes in the graph is 10.

Undefined distances:
If a character does not have a defined distance in our search, it means that the character is not accessible from our source node. This is possible because the graph is not completely connected.
