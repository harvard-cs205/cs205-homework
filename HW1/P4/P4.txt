1.) The graph conssists of all links of two characters. The graph is symmetric, meaning that if (char1, char2) is part of the graph so is (char2, char1).

2.) Number of touched nodes (including starting node):
    
    'CAPTAIN AMERICA': 6408
    'MISS THING/MARY': 7
    'ORWELL': 9

3.) The diameter of the graph is the number of steps BFS needs to execute to touch all nodes that are directly/inderectly connected to the starting node. If a node does not have a defined distance to the starting node, it means that there is no connection between those two nodes.
