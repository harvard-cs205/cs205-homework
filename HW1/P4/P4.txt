1. My graph representation is a key value pair where the key is a character, and the values are a list of all the characters that are directly connected (same issue). 

2. Touched Nodes:
CAPTAIN AMERICA : 6408
MISS THING/MARY : 7
ORWELL : 9

3. The diameter implies that the shortest distance between any two nodes in the graph is bounded by 10, which means the search must be executed in maximum 10 steps. 

4. If a character does not have a defined distance during the search, it means that the character cannot be reached from the source node.
