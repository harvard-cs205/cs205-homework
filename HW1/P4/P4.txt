I represented my graph as an adjacency list, with tuples in the RDD for each
node, with the node and a list of nodes that the node has an edge to.

In my BFS, I am keeping track of all nodes touched, starting from that source.
Originally, this was limited to only the nodes that could be reached in a
number of steps within our limit on the diameter. This means that we would
only expand our frontier at most diameter number of times.
After relaxing assumptions on diameter, it is clear that these nodes are all
those reachable from the source. If a node is in the graph but not in that list
then that node is not reachable from the source.
