


1) What does this diameter imply about the maximum number of steps in which your search must be executed?

	--> The diameter is the number of iterations of breadth first search which must be executed in your graph to find all the connected nodes. 



2) Count the number of nodes touched in each of the above searches and place these counts in your writeup: 

• ”CAPTAIN AMERICA”   Nodes Touched --> 6408, Diameter--> 3

• ”MISS THING/MARY”   Nodes Touched --> 7,    Diameter--> 1

• ”ORWELL”            Nodes Touched--> 9,     Diameter-->1



3) What does it mean if a character does not have a defined distance during the search?

	--> If a character does not have defined distance during the search the the character is not connected to the starting node and is not a member of the starting node's connected components. 



4a) A description of your graph representation

	The graph for problem 4 is represented as an undirected adjacency list. As an example:

		[(Char1, (Char2, Char3))
		(Char2, (Char1, Char3))
		(Char3, (Char1, Char2))]



4b) and the number of touched nodes in each of the searches above.

	--> See the answer for question 2), under "Nodes Touched -->"
