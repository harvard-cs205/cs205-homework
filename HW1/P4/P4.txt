Graph Representation:
The original graph is represented as:
[char,[neighborhoods]]
This graph is adjacency lists. It is much more compact representation and easy to compute.

In this problem, the graph is represented as:
[char,(shortest_distance,[neighbors])]

Before we reached the specific point, the distance is set to infinity. 

After running the program, I got the result as follow:
“CAPTAIN AMERICA”, counted the root node itself, there are 6408 nodes.
“MISS THING/MARY”, counted the root node itself, there are 7 nodes
“ORWELL”, counted the root node itself, there are 9 nodes. 


What does the diameter mean?

The diameter of the graph can be interpreted as how deep this graph is. So, in our problem, we starts from one node, and traverse level-by-level (breadth-first). After reach the level of the diameter, we will have reached every single nodes in the graph. 


What does it mean if a character does not have a defined distance during the search?

It means we haven’t reached to that node. In my program, for all those untouched nodes, the distance is set as infinity.
