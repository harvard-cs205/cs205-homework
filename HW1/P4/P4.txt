The output are showed as below:

- Number of nodes touched 
CAPTAIN AMERICA： 6408         
MISS THING/MARRY： 7           
ORWELL： 9             

- Diameter
CAPTAIN AMERICA： 3         
MISS THING/MARRY： 1           
ORWELL： 1  

In this question, I created a graph in the form of an list of (hero_i, neighbor_j). And then I use the distinct() function to remove those pairs whose neighbors are themselves. In the bfs() function, I start from the origin node (dist=0) and search for all its neighbors (dist=1). And then I iteratively search for the neighbors of all these new found nodes (dist +=1) until there is no longer new neighbor. 

The graph diameters are also showed above. The diameter of a graph means the maximum number of iterations required for an inquired node. And a character that does not have a defined distance implies it is not connected with the source character.
