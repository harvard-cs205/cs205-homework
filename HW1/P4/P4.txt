The graph diameter (10) implies that you only need to do 10 BFS iterations after the root/start node is set to distance 0. 
This is because every node connected to the root node is at most a distance of 10 edges away from the root node.
If a character does not have a defined distance during the search, it means no path exists between the root node and the 
character with undefined distance.

Number of Touched Nodes for each character:

CAPTAIN AMERICA: 6408/6444
MISS THING/MARY: 7/6444
ORWELL: 9/6444

Connected Components sizes of the undirected Marvel graph:

[6408, 1, 7, 9, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Connected Component sizes at each iteration:

CAPTAIN AMERICA: [1, 1907, 6370, 6408]
MISS THING/MARY: [1, 7]
ORWELL: [1, 9]
