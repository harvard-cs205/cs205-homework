1) The graph diameter is the maximum distance that has been reached during the BFS.

2) If a character does not have a defined distance during the search, it means that it is not in the graph!

About the graph representation:
I took time to document the code very well, so please refer to the code.
Quick summary:
- For the BFS I used the following RDD: each node has this structure (k,v), where v has 3 component:
    (key=name of a hero,
    value =[distance to the root, [list of connexion], flag: 0 if not seen, 1 if marked, 2 if visited])

Use of the accumulator as a stopping condition (nota bene: it could have been a python variable).
I stop the search when there is no marked nodes anymore. So when I hit this condition I increment the accumulator.
