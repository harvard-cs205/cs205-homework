1. A description of my graph representation:

In my graph representation, 
each rdd tuple key is a character, 
corresponding rdd tuple value is a list of characters that have connection with key,
here "having connection with" means they appear in the same issue.



2. number of touched nodes in each of the searches:

CAPTAIN AMERICA:
1906
4463
38
0
number of touched nodes = 1(itself distance=0) + 1906(distance=1) + 4463(distance=2) + 38(distance=3) = 6408

MISS THING/MARY:
6
0
number of touched nodes = 1(itself distance=0) + 6(distance=1) = 7

ORWELL:
8
0
number of touched nodes = 1(itself distance=0) + 8(distance=1) = 9



3. discuss the two questions

What does this diameter imply about the maximum number of steps in which your
search must be executed?
Answer: diameter 10 is the maximum number of steps in which my search must be executed,
that is, I can touch all possible nodes in at most 10 steps.

What does it mean if a character does not have a defined distance during the
search?
Answer: not having a defined distance means it can not be touched from the current starting node.
