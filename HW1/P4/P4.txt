The diameter implies that the maximumum number of steps that we need to execute in the search is 10. 

If a character does not have a distance after the search has terminated, that means that there are no paths through charcaters that appear in a comic with the source. I.e., the target has never been in an issue with anyone who is reachable from the source (by being in issues with the source, the sources neighbors, etc.). 

The bfs function that I implemnted accepts a graph in adjacency list form. That is, an RDD keyed on nodes whose values are the list of nodes from whith an edge from the key exists. During the bfs we change to a representation that includes a distance and explored flag along with the neighbors list as the RDD value. The explored flag tells us whether we have never visited the node (0), visited it but not its neighbors (1), or visited it and its neighbors (2). Each distance is initailized to np.inf and when the procedure terminates, will contain the correct distance to the source node.
