My graph representation was:
character -> [characters in the same comic books]

Touched nodes (including root):
CAPTAIN AMERICA: 6408
MISS THING/MARY: 7
ORWELL: 9

The diameter for a connected graph represents the maximum 
distance between any two nodes in the graph, which means 
in a bfs it should take at most that many iterations to 
reach any node in the graph.

If a node is untouched it indicates that the graph is
disconnected or that it has a higher diameter.
