Note that my code for the BFS is in the "network_commands" module in the directory above. I wanted to put all of my
network code in the same place (multiple problems deal with networks).

My graph is represented by (superhero, [superheroes linked to]). It can be thought of as
(A, [B, C, D...]). Note that this representation is inherently directional, i.e. (A, [B]) does not
imply (B, [A]), but the network is initialized so that it is symmetric.

Well, if the maximum diameter is 10, the BFS must be finished by step 10. The diameter is the greatest
distance between any pair of nodes on a graph (taking the shortest path possible between them), and the BFS
takes the shortest path between all nodes starting from a seed node.

>>What does it mean if a character does not have a defined distance during the search?

It means that they were not touched during the updates; they are not connected to the
original node.

### Results ###

* Captain America is connected to 6407 other characters; 6408 nodes touched total (including Captain America).
* Miss Thing/Mary is connected to 6 other characters; 7 nodes touched total.
* Orwell is connected to 8 other characters; 9 nodes touched total.
