I would like to start by acknowledging the help of Andrew Putschek and Taylor Killian who guided me towards the subtractByKey() function.

*** GRAPH REPRESENTATION ***

I used an flat edgelist representation, inspired by the wikipedia representation of P5. By flat, I mean that very edge is present. It is explicitly undirected, which means that both (a,b) and (b,a) are present in the edgelist if A and B appear in the same comic issue.

*** Results ****

• MISS THING/MARY:
7 nodes touched

• ORWELL:
9 nodes touched

• CAPTAIN AMERICA:
6408 nodes touched

*** Extra discussion ***

The assumption of the diameter can be in my opinion disregarded as long as a break condition on the number of neighbours visited is present in the while loop. The diameter then only appears as a safety guideline, that will avoid the algorithm looping for ever in case something wrong happens.
