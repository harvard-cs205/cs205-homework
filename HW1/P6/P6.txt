# Approach
We create the RDD in the specifications after pre-processing and filtering out certain words using
regular expressions.

To select words, we randomly sample a starting word. Then we select some number in the range (0,1) uniformly.
After normalizing each count for all posible next words, we subtract the normalized count from the random number.
If this result is less than 0, then we select the current word, otherwise we move on to the next word. This way,
we have a method for word selection biased based on the word counts.
