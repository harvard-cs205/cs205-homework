Explanation of the next word generation:

For the second order Markov Chain. I chose to use a multinomial probability
to keep a bias on the count.
For exemple if we have for the current tuple:
(w1,w2)

and its value in the occurence graph is:
[(w3, a), (w4, b), (w5, c)]
Then we have the following marginal probability:
p(w3|w1,w2) = a^2 / (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
p(w4|w1,w2) = b^2 / (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
p(w5|w1,w2) = c^2 / (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
