# solutions for HW2 - P5

1) Adding prange to all three areas indicated in the skeleton code actually slowed down the code. Adding prange to only the "subupdate" part of the code, gave a marginal speedup for four threads and a more substantial speedup for 8 threads. 

Average simulation frames per second  N
5.13                                  1
5.68                                  4
8.45                                  8

2) The gridded version is significantly faster due to the improvement in the algorithm in going from O(N^2) to O(N) when it comes to identifying which balls the given ball will collide with. It also seems like the parallel threads are having more of an impact with the grid than without the grid when compared to the serial version.
