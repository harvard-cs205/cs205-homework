P5: 
1. The speed is faster.
More simulation frames per second is achieved. Because multiple threads work on physics at the same time.

2. With O(N) algorithm, it is much faster than O(N^2).
Sort the four modes in order as the first one with highest speed:
O(N) + 4 threads > O(N) + 1 thread > O(N^2) + 4 threads > O(N^2) + 1 thread

3. Sorting speeds up both 4 threads and 1 thread.
Because data is arranged in sequential memory areas, so that data access is accelerated.
So 4 threads, the effect is more obvious, since all access time for 4 threds all increased.

4. Adding lockes increases variability in speed, and it reduced the speed for 4 threads strongly.
For one thread, it has no sense to use locks, but if added, it will add extra overhead.
