MULTITHREADING

Running with 1 thread:

4.98833167028 simulation frames per second
4.82090608995 simulation frames per second
4.88935517413 simulation frames per second
4.8519465376 simulation frames per second

Running with 4 threads:

12.9356410604 simulation frames per second
11.3836758954 simulation frames per second
10.6175234662 simulation frames per second
10.3843310465 simulation frames per second
11.5414888377 simulation frames per second

We can clearly see a nice speedup as in this part the threads
are free to do own work without any contention.

SPATIAL DECOMPOSITION

Running with 1 thread:

75.7404473551 simulation frames per second
97.9068271874 simulation frames per second
57.839172604 simulation frames per second
56.2348445743 simulation frames per second

Running with 4 threads:

152.793321393 simulation frames per second
154.430402739 simulation frames per second
241.834061044 simulation frames per second
184.103739748 simulation frames per second

We  see there's a speed-up from 1 to 4 threads and using spatial
decomposition clearly achieves speed up over the pure multi-threading
approach.
