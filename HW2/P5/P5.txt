### SUB-PROBLEM #1 ###
######################
Serial - 4.73236436339 simulation frames per second

Multithreaded:
1 thread - 4.72723871051 simulation frames per second
2 threads - 7.3402063299 simulation frames per second
4 threads - 10.2033565978 simulation frames per second

1 Threaded Multithreaded is around the same speed as the serial version.  Double the number of threads to 2 doesn't quite double the number of simulation frames per second.  Doubling the number of threads again to 4 gives us an even smaller gain, less than 50%.

Before, the algorithm checked every id after the ith ball to see if the two balls collided.  Now we only need to check a 5x5 square centered on the ball in the grid to ensure that there are no balls within 2-squares of the current ball, because that is the most that a ball could be away and still collide with the ball we are examining in one time interval.  This gives us more than a 130x increase in speed!
