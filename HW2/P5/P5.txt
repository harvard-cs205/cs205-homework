Note: my computer is >4 years old, so performance is not up to par with
standards.

Multithreading
1 thread: ~3 sim/second
4 threads: ~400 sim/second

4 threads is 133 times faster than 1 thread because the computation is easily
divided up into parallel threads.

Spatial decomposition
1 thread: ~280 sim/second
4 threads: ~450 sim/second

There is a significant increase in simulation rate when we employ spatial
decomposition because we reduce from O(N^2) to O(N), checking a small square
per ball rather than the entire list of balls.

Spatially Coherent Sorting
1 thread: ~290 sim/second
4 thread: ~540 sim/second

There is a small increase here from spatial decomp to spatial sorting, mostly
because it isn't a huge time commitment to search through the positions to find
the nearest ball.

Locking

4 threads: ~500 sim/second

Locking actually slows the speed down slightly because we lock a ball down while
operating on it, increasing the time it takes.
