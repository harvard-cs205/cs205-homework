SUBPROBLEM 1: Multithreading
---------------------------------------

For the serial case the average number of simulation frames per second is 13.

When using 4 threads with prange a chunksize of count/100 = 1e3 the average number of simulation frames per second is 50.

We can play with the chunksize. Using a chunksize of count/4 leads to an average number of simulation frames per second of 30.
