For all the following results we run the algorithm for 1000 iterations and take an average of the simulation frames per second.

Multithreading:

For 1 thread:
5.34661775091 simulation frames per second

For 2 threads:
8.77800008371

For 4 threads:
8.35898376155 simulation frames per second

Spatial decomposition:

For 1 thread:
6891.04918303 simulation frames per second

For 2 threads:
7885.8477857 simulation frames per second

For 4 threads:
3527.8577946 simulation frames per second
