It seems like we get a great improvement from 1 to 2 threads, but then afterwards the adding more threads doesn't help us too much. The reason is similar to that of problem 1, where if we use more fine-grained locking, sometimes the overhead will be quite large that it cancels out the time gained by having extra threads.
