For this problem, we perform embarassingly parallel work by
having threads perform filtering pass within each iteration.
Because each thread works on separate set of lines, there is
no need for synchronization, thus we get simple and easy
speedup. Alternatively (not implemented), one could spawn N
standing threads and have each thread lock the current row it's
working on. This way we'd be able to achieve asynchronous execution.
