We launch all the tread with .start()

We create a matrix of size num_thread * iterations to check the status of completion.

If the iterations i-1 of the thread n-1, n and n+1 (located in matrix events_matrix[n-1:n+1,i-1]) are done, then we run the function.

For 1 thread it takes: 4.5 s
For 2 threads it takes 7.6 s 
For 4 threads it takes 7.7 s
