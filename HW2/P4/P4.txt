I used the start/join method along with a list of semaphores to finish this problem. I think the start/join might be sufficient for this problem too because one of my friends used only start/join without semaphores to get almost the same speed up. I used start/join method because it is the most convinient way to solve this problem. 
Semaphores are used to secured syncronization and solve the race problem.

For N = 1:
3.49263596535 seconds for 10 filter passes.

N = 2:
1.4813439846 seconds for 10 filter passes.

N = 4:
0.791718959808 seconds for 10 filter passes.

As shown above, the running time had a liner scale speed up as expected.
