By threading, we introduce substantial speed-ups in the image processing. As shown in P4_perf_times.png, 1 threads took 3.70774197578 sec, 2 threads took 1.84610795975 sec, and 4 threads took 0.984573841095 sec. As we expect, n threads speed up the process by a factor of n. P4_image_correctness.png shows that the processed images by the threaded versions don't look terribly wrong (subtle differences would be hard to see so this visualization is not a sensitive one), but their accuracies are guaranteed by their satisfying the assert statements in the code. It is peculiar that the numpy version would be much slower than the 1-thread version of the code, and I am not sure why this is.
