With 1 thread:
    3.43267893791 seconds for 10 filter passes.
With 2 threads:
    1.73779916763 seconds for 10 filter passes.
With 4 threads:
    1.00545978546 seconds for 10 filter passes.

As we increase the number of threads 1 to 2, we see almost the performance almost double, as 10 filter passes take a little more than half of the time using 2 threads instead of 1.  When we increase the number of threads from 2 to 4, we again see an increase as 10 filter passes take about 4/7ths of the time with 4 threads as with 2 threads.
