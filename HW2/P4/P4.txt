Implementation

  To make sure that threads do not collide with each other, I had a pair of semaphores (lower, upper) for each thread, all initialized with a count of 1.

  When thread (n) is about to start an iteration, it acquires the upper semaphore of the (n-1) thread and the lower semaphore of the (n+1) thread.  Once it finishes the iteration, it increments its own lower and upper semaphores.

  Sematically, the semaphores serve as signals.  Thread (n) checks the (n-1) and (n+1) signals (i.e. acquiring the sempaphores) before performing an itertation.  It then sends signals to the (n-1) and (n+1) threads saying it has completed (i.e. releasings its own semaphores)

  This design also allows threads to begin an iteration of filtering asychronously, since we only wait for the semaphores of the n-1 and n+1 threads to be incremented before starting the next iteration.
