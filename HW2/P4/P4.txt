The multithreading process is as follows:

Each thread n has their neighbors n-1 and n+1 (wraps around so if n=0 then 
n-1 is the last thread, vice versa for n+1 in the last thread's case).

There are two stages - calculation of the medians and swapping tmpA/tmpB.
The calculation stage at iteration i for thread n cannot happen until n's 
neighbors have copied iteration i-1

The swapping stage at iteration i for thread n cannot happen until n's neighbors
have calculated iteration i-1

I check these using three lists - condition objects, iteration count for calcs, 
iteration count for swaps

When a thread n either calculates or swaps it updates the respective list 
and does a notifyAll on it's condition object.

Prior to doing any calculation/swap it checks that the respective neighbor 
indices in the lists are satisfied, if not it'll wait on the neighbor's condition object.

Note this process should satisfy the extra credit as each thread is only 
waiting on it's neighbors not any others.

I've included a P4_plot.png to show the calculation time for threads = [1,2,4,8]. 
2 threads doesn't have much speedup as the two threads are neighbors so the overhead
of waiting/notifying between the two may exceed the parallelized calculation. As 
the threads increase the speedup is more pronounced.
