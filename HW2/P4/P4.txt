From the experiment results above, 1, 2, and 4-way parallel performance are almost the same. I think this is due to the fact that only one thread can execute Python code at once, that is, each thread actually runs in serial.

As for choices to control cooperation between threads, I used locks. This is to ensure that no two threads can access data in same line simultaneously.
