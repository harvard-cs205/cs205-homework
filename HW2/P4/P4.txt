There is a increase in speed of roughly 2 from 1-2 threads and 2-4.

There is an event set for each iteration x thread that we initialize.
Then we start off the first iteration for all the threads at once, because
there's nothing to check at first. We set the events for the first iteration
so that the next iterations know that the first iteration is done. Then,
using basic logic to make sure we stay in bounds of our events array, we wait
for the previous iteration on thread n-1 and n+1 are finished, and then proceed
with the filtering.
