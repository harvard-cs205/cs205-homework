As seen in the graph we see that the performance of 4 threads is slightly better 
than 2 threads but both outperform the 1 threaded implementation. 

The method of implementation is using events. I use an event for every iteration 
and thread. Hence its a list for every thread which is inside a list. Using
event.wait() the function waits for the required events to be set after which I 
initialize the filtering function and carry the swap as well while holding 
on to the event which is set after the assignment is completed. This fits the
extra credit portion since it allows the next threads to start which have been
waiting for the event to be completed.
