num_threads = 1 
3.74442445784 seconds for 10 filter passes.

num_threads = 2
1.81543213413 seconds for 10 filter passes.

num_threads = 4
1.74263123239 seconds for 10 filter passes.


From the result, we can find that when the num_threads from 1 change to 2, the running time reduced a lot, but when num_threads still increasing to change from 2 to 4, the time is not have significant change.
