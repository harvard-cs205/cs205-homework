number of threads=1, 2.54070901871 seconds for 10 filter passes.
number of threads=2, 1.27839994431 seconds for 10 filter passes.
number of threads=4, 0.679213047028 seconds for 10 filter passes.

From output above, we can see that 4-threads version > 2-threads version > 1-thread version

For iteration i, I run it in parallel with number of threads. And then I wait until all threads are finished and start iteration i+1.
