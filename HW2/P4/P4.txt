# VERSION THAT CREATES NEW THREADS AT EACH ITERATIONS

I create new thread at each iterations. At the end of each iterations, I join them and then swap the matrices.

# VERSION FOR EXTRA CREDIT


We launch all the tread with .start()

We create a matrix of size num_thread * iterations to check the status of completion.

If the iterations i-1 of the thread n-1, n and n+1 (located in matrix events_matrix[n-1:n+1,i-1]) are done, then we run the function.


# RESULTS FROM THE VERSION THAT CREATES THREADS AT EACH ITERATIONS

For 1 thread it takes: 4.7 s
For 2 threads it takes 2.7 s 
For 4 threads it takes 2.5 s
