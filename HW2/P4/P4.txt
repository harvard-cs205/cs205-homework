Let's compare the performance in each scenario.

Num threads: 1
4.41142241955 seconds for 10 filter passes averaged over 10 runs.

Num threads: 2
2.53045721054 seconds for 10 filter passes averaged over 10 runs.

Num threads: 3
2.89352252483 seconds for 10 filter passes averaged over 10 runs.

Num threads: 4
2.20505132675 seconds for 10 filter passes averaged over 10 runs.

>>Your writeup comparing 1, 2, and 4-way parallel performance, and discussion
of your implementation choices to control cooperation between threads.

The method I use to control cooperation between threads is relatively straightforwards. If we have N threads, the nth
thread processes every Nth line starting with n. Within a single
iteration, each thread can update their assigned rows independently of the other threads, as they take information from
the input image, act on it, and put the filtered data into the output image. To avoid problems, we must avoid updating
the input image until each thread has finished transforming data from the input image to the output image. To wait
until each thread is done using the input image, we simply use thread_n.join() on each thread. Once we have waited for
each thread to complete, we take the output filtered image and use it as an input for the next iteration. My
technique does not create any buffers, i.e. I use tmpA and tmpB as is.

See the plots "time_vs_threads.png" and "speedup_vs_threads.png" for a summary of how my parallelization technique
performed. With 2 and 3 threads, we obtain a speedup of approximately 1.5, and with 4 threads we obtain
a speedup of approximately 2.0. Adding additional cores does not seem to efficiently speed up our code; naively,
we expect that N cores will speed up our code by a factor of N. Instead, we are seeing something like N cores gives
us a speedup of 0.5N. This inefficiency could be created by two effects:

1) Our code to create parallelism comes at a high cost, i.e. python threads require a lot of computational overhead
2) Different rows take vastly different amounts of time to complete; each thread is not appropriately load balanced

2 seems unlikely as I expect the work per pixel to be roughly the same for a simple median filter. I expect that
the inefficiency is caused by 1), as python threading is likely much slower than C threading. Instead of
creating and controlling threads in python, we should simply parallelize the inner loop in cython with prange; I bet
that would create much more efficient speedups.
