With 2 threads the speedup is around 2 times relative to serial. However, with 4 threads, the run time is only slightly faster than 2 threads.
In this implemention of the 3x3 median filter, we wait until iteration i finishes before starting iteration i + 1. Therefore, no threads start an iteration of filtering before the data for that iteration is ready.
