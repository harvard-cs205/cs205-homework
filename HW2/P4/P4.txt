1. Compare Performance

1) thread 1:
3.40274882317 seconds for 10 filter passes.

2) thread 2:
1.72616195679 seconds for 10 filter passes.

3) thread 4:
1.55127882957 seconds for 10 filter passes.

The computation time is improved as the number of threads increased.


2. Method I chose to control cooperation between threads

- I chose to use thread.Event() to control cooperation between threads.
I implementd 2D array, size of [iteration(row) * thread_idx(column)],
and each cell in this array contains thread.Event() obejct for a given iteration and a given thread index number.
Since the thread n has to wait threads n, n-1, and n+1 in iteration i-1,
I implemented the code to wait for those Event.
The code is like following 

    event_array[iteration-1][thread_idx - 1].wait()
    event_array[iteration-1][thread_idx].wait()
    event_array[iteration-1][thread_idx + 1].wait()
