Problem 4: Image Processing

Part 1: Discussing about implementation choice

In this problem, I used "Event" to communicate between threads. Since we are required to make sure the completion of
threads of n, n-1,and n+1 have all finished i - 1 iteration. So before one event is kicked off, three singals have to
be received. The basic logic is written as follows:

-> thread(n,i) stops for waiting signals from other three event(event1,event2,event3)

-> if event1(n-1,i-1) finished, send the signal1

-> if event2(n,i-1) finished, send the signal2

-> if event3(n+1,i-1) finished, send the signal3.

Only if those three signals were received, the thread(n,i) could be started.

Thus, after one event is finished, it has to send a "set" signal.


Part2: Performance and Results

1 thread:
3.20314788818 seconds for 10 filter passes.

2 threads:
1.68510913849 seconds for 10 filter passes.

4 threads:
0.951035022736 seconds for 10 filter passes.

According to results above, the performance has been improved SIGNIFICANTLY, showing the benefit of using parallel
computing. Also, the results prove our implementation is correct.
However, I have noticed that using 4 threads doesn't improve the performance four times. I think when I introduced
Event object into the program, it also cause overhead delay. Also, parallel computing has overhead cost itself also.
So, I expected the improvement of performance wouldn't be over four times.
