Your writeup comparing 1, 2, and 4-way parallel performance, and discus-
sion of your implementation choices to control cooperation between threads

N = 1
T = 3.97963690758

N = 2
T = 2.78399991989

N = 4
T = 1.81781697273

N = 8
T = 2.14809894562

Shown in the results above (and the graph), I got linear'ish speedup when adding more threads.

I used a start/join method to coordinate different threads. I don't have to worry about betwee-iterations
because the whole picture is processed before the next iteration (threads) starts. However, a faster approach
may be able to compute across different iterations at the same time.
