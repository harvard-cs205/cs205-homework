The output of the time when N=10 is:

Serial uncorrelated: 0.613505840302 seconds
Fine grained uncorrelated: 4.70983815193 seconds
Medium grained uncorrelated: 7.92237710953 seconds

Serial correlated: 0.674780130386 seconds
Fine grained correlated: 4.54506778717 seconds
Medium grained correlated: 6.94881796837 seconds

No matter for uncorrelated or correlated data, serial implementation are the fastest among the three and Fine
grained implementation is faster than medium grained. Medium grained implementation does better when the data
is correlated.

From this plot we could see that the best N to choose for medium-grained locking in the correlated case is 20.
However, for the uncorrelated case, it seems like larger N has worse performance.
