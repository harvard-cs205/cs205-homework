# ## Locking explained

Fine grained: one lock per ceil.

Medium grained: the same lock is shared for each group of ceils of indices between k * N and (k+1) * N in the array.

# ## Medium Grained Value analysis

I plot over 4 iterations the minimum and the average value of the execution time for 12 values of N in both cases, correlated and uncorrelated.
It seems that for the uncorrelated a bigger value, around 10 is more suited, and for the correlated mostly around 5.
