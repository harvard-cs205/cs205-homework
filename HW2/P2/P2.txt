# solution to P2

For both uncorrelated or correlated problem, the serial version is very fast, much faster than any parallel version I could provide. It is because in this problem parallel version creates locks and derives overheads which take up most of the time.

Comparing fine-grained and medium-grained cases, we notice medium-grained method with N = 1 is equivalent to fine-grained method in theory. (Practically some additional calculation is added, there is a difference of one second.) There is a trade-off for the number of locks - generally speaking, with more locks, we increase concurrency but also overheads. For uncorrelated problem, using less locks decrease concurrency sharply, that we observed increasing time spend with increasing N. However for correlated problem, using less locks do not decrease concurrency much if N is decent. A recommended choice of N would be 50.
