The locked versions take significantly longer time than the serial versions. This may be due to expensive overheads of locking in comparison to the relatively fast tasks that each thread does. 

For N = 10, the medium-grained-uncorrelated took significantly longer time than the fine-grained-uncorrelated version, whereas for the correlated version, the medium-grained version only took slightly longer time than the fine-grained version. For uncorrelated, there is a higher chance that two threads may be accessing the same medium-grained lock for either source or destination. This means that one of the threads will have to wait for the other thread to finish, resulting in huge delays. In the correlated version, as the source and destinations are no more than 10 elements away, there is a high chance that the source and destination is within the same lock, hence there is less chance of one thread waiting for the other. 

The fine-grained-version runs faster as there is even less chance of of two threads accessing the same lock.

As can be seen for the runtime when N = 2, 4 and 8, the medium grained runtime increases as N increases. Hence, the best value for N is N =1, ie the fine-grained version.
