We can see from the uncorrelated data, parallel computing time is more and more longer as added more locks. It is much longer running time than serial case. From the vector of N, N = 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500. The smaller N might be a good choice of parameter. The two entries exchanging data are not likely to be near each other, counts[dest[idx]] and counts[src[idx]] both need a lock.

We can see from the correlated data, parallel computing time is relatively shorter as added more locks. It is longer running time than serial case, but not that bad as with uncorrelated data. From the vector N = 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500. We can see parameter N for medium-grained lock, the running time looks like a U-shape as different number of parameter N added. 

Therefore, fine-grained case is faster than medium-grained case since each job does not need to wait for other jobs to be done as every entry of the array has indivisual lock. However, in Medium-grained case, there are many cases where jobs are stalled because other jobs have locks for memory.
