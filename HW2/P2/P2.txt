Based on the data (see medium.svg, which is I git added to this directory), we see that
in the uncorrelated case, we should use a small number of locks, around 10.  In the 
correlated case, it makes the most sense to use a number of locks around 30-40.  This allows the right
balance in the tradeoff between the computational overhead of having a lot of locks around and locking them
vs. the benefit of being able to lock a single lock to modify two data elements.  This makes sense --
in the uncorrelated case, we are very unlikely to have the same lock be able to modify both data elements,
while in the correlated case, this looks to be happneing all the time with a lock size of around 10. Note:
in the correlated model, things being switched are within 10 spots of each other, so it makes sense that
a size of around 20-40 will be good, such that it is unlikely for us to have to grab another lock group
(only necessary across halves).
