ideas: serial is the fastest because we aren't really doing any computation and the locking overhead causes an increase in time
medium is slower than fine-grained in general because with medium-grained locking you run into more issues where one thread is waiting for another to
finish, but you have less locks and (although not in this case) generally will have less complicated code

massive slowdown for medium-grained locking in the correlated case if you have <10 locks because then there will be many collisions
