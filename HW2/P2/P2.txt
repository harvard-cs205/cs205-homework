***** PLEASE NOTE *****

I had originally chosen to first acquire the lock of dest[idx], perform the update and release it afterward and then to the same with src[idx]. But talking to Isadora Nun, she mentioned that there might be a smarter way to do it by looking starting locking the minimum of of the two dest[idx] and src[idx], which I found more elegant and therefore chose to implement.

Results:

The first thing we can notice is that both in the uncorrelated and correlated case, the serial code works much much faster than the parallel codes. We get a completion time of about 0.25s (unc) / 0.3s  (c) whereas we are more in the 6s to 9s for the parallel.

I then observed that when using uncorrelated data, fine grained works better than medium grained by a second. We get a 6.15s time for fine grained, when the best medium grained time is obtained by a second when using 1 lock. The completion time increases with number of locks for uncorrelated data.

For the correlated data set, medium grained slightly outperforms fine grained. We seem to find an optimum number of lock in the interval [19,23] depending of the experiments. The results are the following and we add a plot:
