For both correlated and uncorrelated data, the serial implementation is the fastest.  This is because the parallel implementation incurs both communication costs and time spent acquiring and releasing locks.  Using medium-grained locks slows the computation further because many elements are locked along with the element of interest.  For both locked versions, using correlated data speeds the computation because memory accesses are faster.  

I experimented with a wide range of N values approximately logarithmically spaced between N=1 and N=1000.  N=1 corresponds with a fine-grained implementation (every element has its own lock), and N=1000 corresponds with a serial implementation (All the elements use the same lock).  

The results of my experimentation are displayed in P2.png.  
For the uncorrelated data, spacing the locks more widely slows the computation down because it causes threads to wait for each other more because they become more likely to be trying to acquire the same lock.  The exception to this is N=1000 (serial implementation), which compensates for this by reducing the overhead of acquiring and releasing locks.  

For the correlated data, spacing the locks more widely generally slows the computation down for the same reason as the uncorrelated data (more threads waiting for each other), however there is a notable exception at N=20, which guarantees that all the threads will use only one lock each, thereby reducing the aquiring/releasing overhead.  This is still no faster than the fine-grained (N=1) implementation, however, because it still increases the amount that threads have to wait for one another.  

The correlated data almost always runs faster than the uncorrelated data because the correlated data will have fewer threads waiting for each other.  

The correlated and uncorrelated runtimes converge for N=1000 (serial).  This makes sense, because this removes the advantage of correlation (with only one thread, correlating the data no longer benefits the computation by reducing threads waiting for each other).
