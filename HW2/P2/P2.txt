The first observation after the implementation of the locks were that its considerably slower slower than the serial version which in this case is the coarse grained locking. The fine grained locking is much slower than the serial implementation due to the overhead with the locks even though we have paralellized over 4 threads. The same can be said for the medium grained locking as well. The medium grained locking took higher time than fine grained locking because the locks take time to be released and lesser the number of locks more the time it takes for the function to run. The uncorrelated transfers take higher time than the correlated transfers in the cases where locking is used.
