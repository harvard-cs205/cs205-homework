In general, because this task is memory-bound rather than compute-bound, parallelizing slows it down (regardless of the level of locking) because of increased overhead.
With fine-grained locking, the correlated transfers are somewhat faster than the uncorrelated transfers, perhaps because if a thread just had a particular lock, it's slightly less likely that any other thread is trying to modify any of the nearby elements, so that thread can pick up its next lock a little more quickly.
I tested medium-grained locking varying from one lock per element (equivalent to fine-grained locking) to one lock for all the elements (equivalent to coarse-grained locking, zero concurrency). The medium-grained option equivalent to fine-grained locking still took noticeably longer than regular fine-grained locking. I would've expected a slight increase, because there's a little bit of extra logic, but I was surprised by how much of a difference this made.
With truly "medium-grained" locking (i.e., between the two extremes), the uncorrelated transfers receive no speedup relative to fine-grained (and in fact take significantly longer). A smaller number of larger locks in this case only slows the transfers down by decreasing concurrency. However, the correlated transfers receive some speedup relative to fine-grained locking for N between roughly 10 and 80, where concurrency is balanced against a greater likelihood that each thread will only have to grab one lock for both the source and destination elements of counts.
