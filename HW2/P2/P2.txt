2. What we can observe from the output and figure:
1) Performance
Serial > Fine grained parallel > Medium grained parallel
correlated > uncorrelated
Note that fine grained and medium grained are significantly slower than serial, my slow cpu also made the parallel cases perform worse.
Also fine-grained case is faster than medium-grained case since in the former each job has there own lock and does not need to wait for
others, whereas in the latter jobs oftne have to wait becuase other jobs own locks for memory.

In the correlated version, as the src and dest are within 10 elements distance, there is a high chance that the src and dest is within the same lock,
thus the possibility of one thread waiting for the other descreases.

2) N choice for medium-grained locking
I tested the performance of medium-grained locking using N = 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, 100
As shown in the output figure, the tansfer time goes up and down between N = 5 ~ 30, and reached minimum (best performance) in N = 30 in both
correlated and uncorrelated cases; when N > 30,  the transfer time increases with number of locks. Overall, a good N should be chosen form 10 -30
depending on different machines and src, dest distribution.
