The first observation after the implementation of the locks were that its 
considerably slower  than the serial version which in this case is the coarse 
grained locking. The fine grained locking is much slower than the serial 
implementation due to the overhead with the locks even though we have paralellized
over 4 threads. The same can be said for the medium grained locking as well. 
The medium grained locking took higher time than fine grained locking because the
locks take time to be released and lesser the number of locks more the time it 
takes for the function to run. The uncorrelated transfers take higher time than
the correlated transfers in the cases where locking is used. As the N increases,
the time increases since there are higher chances a thread waits for one of the
other threads to release the locks.
