Analysis

  Already, without AVX, we see that this problem sees significant speed up when adding threads, almost 2x and 4x speedup respectively, which makes sense since we have 2/4 additional threads for a highly parallelizable function.

  With AVX, we see an additional x7/x8 speed increase for all numbers of threads, which again makes sence since AVX allows 8 instructions to run simultaneously, but we have some overhead to setup the AVX operations.
