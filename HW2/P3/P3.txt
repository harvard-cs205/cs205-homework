parallelization with prange:
	Thread = 1:
		1074.94829 Million Complex FMAs in 9.49916887283 seconds
	Thread = 2:
		1074.947782 Million Complex FMAs in 4.37321305275 seconds
	Thread = 4:
		1074.973929 Million Complex FMAs in 2.17788004875 seconds

parallelization with prange + AVX instruction level:
	Thread = 1:
		1074.947782 Million Complex FMAs in 0.867263266965 seconds
	Thread = 2:
		1074.947782 Million Complex FMAs in 0.468961029913 seconds
	Thread = 4:
		1074.947782 Million Complex FMAs in 0.224550029287 seconds

When we parallelize the program without using AVX instruction, the speedup is as expected. As the number of thread double, the time is about the half.

When we parallelize the program with AVX instructions, the program could parallely calculate 0 float numbers. The performance is significantly better than the performance of parallelization with only prange. Also, as the number of threads double, the running time is about half.
