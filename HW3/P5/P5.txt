***Part 4***

Explain, in terms of compute vs. memory, why using a single thread to perform this step is
or is not a reasonable choice. Note that there is some variation in GPUs, so you may want to
discuss your empirical results as well as speculate under what conditions those results might
be different.

***Part 5***

Explain what would happen if instead of using the atomic min() operation, one would use
the min() function. Your explanation should consider whether the final result would still be
correct, what might be the impact on the performance of the algorithm (time and iterations),
could a value in labels ever increase, and could it increase between iterations?
