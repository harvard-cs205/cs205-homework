Part 5:

The benefit of atomic_min is that it performs the calculation and swap
into a single step, writing the min value directly into memory. What this allows
is the elimination of a race condition, because another thread will not be
able to interrupt. Although technically min is faster than atomic_min, iterations
will likely be fewer with atomic_min, because it would be redundant to access
the same spot in memory again to compare, when that value in memory was updated
by another thread.
