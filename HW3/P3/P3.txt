For my machine, any configurations with >32 workers resulted in an error. It also seems that when the gloabl size>4096, then the computation does not complete correctly in the blocked reads case (I see an assertion error). 

With that in mind, the best performance was achieved with the greatest number of workgroups and workers
coalesced reads, workgroups: 512, num_workers: 32, 0.013397824 seconds
blocked reads, workgroups: 128, num_workers: 16, 0.03992816 seconds
