My computer has the following specs:
#0: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5257U CPU @ 2.70GHz on Apple
#1: Intel(R) Iris(TM) Graphics 6100 on Apple

It appears that the best configuration is not always the same across different runs. The best configurations appear to
be toward the largest number of work groups and workers, which is intuitive. However, it also seems that the marginal
benefit of getting more work groups and workers is very small.
