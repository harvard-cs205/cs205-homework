Best configuration on my hardware:
----
configuration ('coalesced', 32, 32): 0.013592032 seconds

Coalesced reads were uniformly better on my machine than blocked reads, across all numbers of workgroups and workers.
In coalesced.png and blocked.png, you can see that increasing the number of workgroups above 32 makes essentially no difference, although there is a significant difference in performance between 8, 16, and 32 workgroups.
Increasing the number of workers makes a significant difference as well, although due to system errors as described in Piazza post 501, I could not use local sizes greater than 32, so it is unclear whether the same diminishing returns would apply.
