The best configuration for my machine is:

configuration ('coalesced', 512, 128): 0.000331392 seconds

The coalesced read is faster than the blocked read on average 
for the same number of work groups and workers because more 
threads can do work on the same block of fetched memory. In the
blocked reads, once a thread fetchs its block to sum, more
threads may have to wait to fetch their block of memory. However in the
coalesced reads, more threads can sum elements simultaneously
more often since a fetched block of memory will be more likely to 
contain elements needed by more threads than in the blocked scheme.
