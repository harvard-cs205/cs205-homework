By varying the number of workgroups, number of workers in each, and comparing blocked vs coalesced reads, we find that the fastest performance comes from coalesced reads for 64 workgroups nad 128 workers, at 0.00239 seconds. 
From P3.png, which plots time taken vs number of workers for coaleseced (red) vs blocked (blue), where darker colors signify a greater number of workgroups, we find that coalesced reads in general yield faster performance. Furthermore, it seems that more workgroups does not necessarily mean faster performance, although more workers per workgroup generally does mean faster performance.
